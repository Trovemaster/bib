 vibrational spectra that was presented in Avila and Carrington, Jr.
 {[}J. Chem. Phys. 139, 134114 (2013)]. Using an iterative eigensolver,
 energy levels and wavefunctions are determined from values of the
 potential on a Smolyak grid. The kinetic energy matrix-vector product is
 evaluated by transforming a vector labelled with (nondirect product)
 grid indices to a vector labelled by (nondirect product) basis indices.
 Both the transformation and application of the kinetic energy operator
 (KEO) scale favorably. Collocation facilitates dealing with complicated
 KEOs because it obviates the need to calculate integrals of coordinate
 dependent coefficients of differential operators. The ideas are tested
 by computing energy levels of HONO using a KEO in bond coordinates. }},

  Abstract                 = {A review is given on the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets. The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications, MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many (typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24 (!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction. These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator and many model potential functions already have this required structure. For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation (CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed. },

 sets and large product grids when one computes vibrational energy

 advantages of a sum-of-products potential. The key idea is to use a
 basis each of whose function is a sum of optimized products and to
 compress the number of terms in each basis function. When the potential
 does not have the sum-of-products form, it is usually necessary to use
 quadrature. The second idea uses a nondirect product grid that has
 structure and is therefore compatible with efficient matrix-vector
 products.}},

The primary novel feature is that this DVR gives an extremely simple kinetic energy matrix (the potential energy matrix is diagonal, as in all DVRs) which is in a sense ``universal,{''} i.e., independent of any explicit reference to an underlying set of basis functions; it can, in fact, be derived as an infinite limit using different basis functions. An energy truncation procedure allows the DVR grid points to be adapted naturally to the shape of any given potential energy surface. Application to the benchmark collinear H + H2 --> H2 + H reaction shows that convergence in the reaction probabilities is achieved with only about 15\% more DVR grid points than the number of conventional basis functions used in previous S-matrix Kohn calculations. Test calculations for the collinear Cl + HCl --> ClH + Cl reaction shows that the unusual dynamical features of heavy + light-heavy reactions are also well described by this approach. Since DVR approaches avoid having to evaluate integrals in order to obtain the Hamiltonian matrix and since a DVR Hamiltonian matrix is extremely sparse, this DVR version of the S-matrix Kohn approach should make it possible to deal with more complex chemical reactions than heretofore possible.},

  Abstract                 = {Developments during the last two decades in nuclear motion theory made it possible to obtain variational solutions to the time-independent, nuclear-motion Schrodinger equation of polyatomic systems as ``exact'' as the potential energy surface (PES) is. Nuclear motion theory thus reached a level whereby this branch of quantum chemistry started to catch up with the well developed and widely applied other branch, electronic structure theory. It seems to be fair to declare that we are now in the fourth age of quantum chemistry, where the first three ages are principally defined by developments in electronic structure techniques (G. Richards, Nature, 1979, 278, 507). In the fourth age we are able to incorporate into our quantum chemical treatment the motion of nuclei in an exact fashion and, for example, go beyond equilibrium molecular properties and compute accurate, temperature-dependent, effective properties, thus closing the gap between measurements and electronic structure computations. In this Perspective three fundamental algorithms for the variational solution of the time-independent nuclear-motion Schrodinger equation employing exact kinetic energy operators are presented: one based on tailor-made Hamiltonians, one on the Eckart-Watson Hamiltonian, and one on a general internal-coordinate Hamiltonian. It is argued that the most useful and most widely applicable procedure is the third one, based on a Hamiltonian containing a kinetic energy operator written in terms of internal coordinates and an arbitrary embedding of the body-fixed frame of the molecule. This Hamiltonian makes it feasible to treat the nuclear motions of arbitrary quantum systems, irrespective of whether they exhibit a single well-defined minimum or not, and of arbitrary reduced-dimensional models. As a result, molecular spectroscopy, an important field for the application of nuclear motion theory, has almost black-box-type tools at its disposal. Variational nuclear motion computations, based on an exact kinetic energy operator and an arbitrary PES, can now be performed for about 9 active vibrational degrees of freedom relatively straightforwardly. Simulations of high-resolution spectra allow the understanding of complete rotational-vibrational spectra up to and beyond the first dissociation limits. Variational results obtained for H2O, H-3(+), NH3, CH4, and H2CCO are used to demonstrate the power of the variational techniques for the description of vibrational and rotational excitations. Some qualitative features of the results are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {{A simple variational procedure, termed DOPI for discrete variable
 representation-Hamiltonian in orthogonal coordinates-direct product
 basis-iterative diagonalization, is described and applied to compute
 low-lying vibrational band origins (VBOs) of the triatomic systems H2O,
 CO2, and N2O, employing published empirical and theoretical sextic force
 fields. While in these cases no difficulties arise when quartic
 potentials are used, the limited range of applicability of 6th-order
 potentials presents difficulties for the variational determination of
 VBOs, in particular for the higher-lying bending states. For H2O,
 transformation of quadratic and quartic force fields from simple bond
 stretching to Simons-Parr-Finian (SPF) coordinates results in computed
 VBOs deviating less from experiment. This, however, does not hold for
 the VBOs computed from the transformed sextic force fields where the two
 representations provide highly similar results. While use of empirical
 quartic and sextic force fields result in a much better reproduction of
 experimental VBOs than that of ab initio force fields, especially at
 higher (fifth- and sixth-) order the empirical force constants, obtained
 through different refinement procedures, do not correspond to the
 associated derivatives of the potential energy surface (PES). Rotational
 constants characterizing low-lying vibrational states have been
 evaluated as expectation values using inertia tensor formulas in the
 Eckart and principal axis frames. Only the Eckart axes should be used
 for these computations and they yield accurate vibrationally averaged
 rotational constants.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The correlated k-distribution method for radiative transfer in nonhomogeneous atmospheres is discussed in terms of the physical and mathematical conditions under which this method is valid. Two correlated conditions are necessary and sufficient for the exact transformation of the wavenumber integration to an integration over the cumulative probability (g), a monotonically increasing and smooth function in the absorption coefficient space. These conditions involve the use of a reference condition to define the absorption coefficient and an assumption concerning the ordering of the absorption coefficient. The correlated conditions are exact in the context of a single line, periodic lines, and the strong- and weak-line limits. In realistic atmospheres, these assumptions am best for adjacent levels but produce increasing blurring or deviations for distant levels. We investigate the blurring of the correlated assumptions on the computations of fluxes and heating rates based on ``exact{''} line-by-line results, using a variety of atmospheric profiles and spectral intervals containing principal absorbing gases. In the thermal infrared, errors in fluxes am less than 0.2\% for H2O, CO2, CH4, and N2O, and approximately 2\% for O3. Errors in heating rates are less than 0.01 K day-1 for these gases below approximately 30 km. Larger errors of approximately 0.1 K day-1 can occur at some levels above this height. For H2O lines in the solar region, errors in fluxes and heating rates are within 0.05\% and 0.01 K day-1, respectively. Based on numerical experimentation, we find that the number of g values ranging from 1 (for weak bands) to approximately 10 (for strong bands) are usually sufficient to achieve acceptable accuracy for flux and heating rate calculations. The correlated k-distribution method differs fundamentally from the traditional approach that employs scaling approximations and band models to separate height and wavenumber integrations for transmittance calculations. The equivalent k values for various gases computed from this approach can be directly incorporated in the multiple-scattering program involving cloud and aerosol particles.}},

The model assumes that bonding in the nickel halides has the approximate form Ni+X-, with an electronic 3d(9) configuration plus closed shells on the Ni+ moiety and a closed shell configuration on the X- moiety. From a crystal-field point of view, interactions of the positive d-hole with the cylindrically symmetrical electric charge distribution of the hypothetical NiX- closed-shell core can then be parameterized by three terms in a traditional expansion in values comparable with those for the vertical bar Omega vertical bar = 3/2 and vertical bar Omega vertical bar = 5/2 states by fixing A to its value in Ni+ and then introducing an empirical correction factor for one off-diagonal orbital matrix element. In the second part of this paper the usual effective Hamiltonian B(J-L-S)(2) for a rotating diatomic molecule is used to derive expressions for the Q-type doubling parameter p in the two vertical bar Omega vertical bar = 1/2 states. These expressions show (for certain sign conventions) that the sum of the two p values should be similar to 2B, but that their difference can vary between -10B and +10B. These theoretical results are in good agreement with the two observed p values for both NiF and NiCl. The present formalism should in principle be applicable to NiBr and Nil, and to the halides of palladium, since Pd+ has a well isolated 4d(9) electronic ground configuration. Extension to metal halides having d(n) configurations with n < 9, or to platinum halides may present difficulties, since manifolds from the d(n) and d(n-1)s configurations may be heavily mixed, thus requiring ``too many{''} parameters in the electronic part of the problem. Application to linear triatomic molecules may also present problems because of the large number of vibronic perturbations made possible by their four vibrational degrees of freedom.}},

The photochemistry model is designed from the ground up to have the capacity to treat all types of terrestrial planet atmospheres, ranging from oxidizing through reducing, which makes the code suitable for applications for the wide range of anticipated terrestrial exoplanet compositions. The one-dimensional chemical transport model treats up to 800 chemical reactions, photochemical processes, dry and wet deposition, surface emission, and thermal escape of O, H, C, N, and S bearing species, as well as formation and deposition of elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid aerosols. We validate the model by computing the atmospheric composition of current Earth and Mars and find agreement with observations of major trace gases in Earth's and Mars' atmospheres. We simulate several plausible atmospheric scenarios of terrestrial exoplanets and choose three benchmark cases for atmospheres from reducing to oxidizing. The most interesting finding is that atomic hydrogen is always a more abundant reactive radical than the hydroxyl radical in anoxic atmospheres. Whether atomic hydrogen is the most important removal path for a molecule of interest also depends on the relevant reaction rates. We also find that volcanic carbon compounds (i.e., CH 4 and CO 2 ) are chemically long-lived and tend to be well mixed in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres, and their dry deposition velocities to the surface control the atmospheric oxidation states. Furthermore, we revisit whether photochemically produced oxygen can cause false positives for detecting oxygenic photosynthesis, and find that in 1 bar CO 2 -rich atmospheres oxygen and ozone may build up to levels that have conventionally been accepted as signatures of life, if there is no surface emission of reducing gases. The atmospheric scenarios presented in this paper can serve as the benchmark atmospheres for quickly assessing the lifetime of trace gases in reducing, weakly oxidizing, and highly oxidizing atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets for the exploration of possible biosignature gases.}

The mean fitting error is found to be only 2.0 x 10(-3) in transmission. These data are essential for the scattering calculations likely to be necessary for analysis of the data from the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer aboard the NASA Galileo spacecraft. The new data have significant advantages over those previously derived by Baines et al. {[}1993] in that they cover a wider spectral range, are applicable to longer paths, and also apply to the hydrogen-broadened case, which is the dominant broadening mechanism in this atmosphere.

  Abstract                 = {The spectral band data derived by Strong et al. {[}1993] for laboratory-measured transmission spectra of hydrogen-broadened methane at 10 cm(-1) resolution have been fitted with k coefficients over a wide range of pressures and temperatures representing those likely to be encountered in the atmosphere of Jupiter. The mean fitting error is found to be only 2.0 x 10(-3) in transmission. These data are essential for the scattering calculations likely to be necessary for analysis of the data from the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer aboard the NASA Galileo spacecraft. The new data have significant advantages over those previously derived by Baines et al. {[}1993] in that they cover a wider spectral range, are applicable to longer paths, and also apply to the hydrogen-broadened case, which is the dominant broadening mechanism in this atmosphere. A similar table has also been calculated for the self-broadening case for comparison.},

  Abstract                 = {The conformation and dynamical behavior of molecular systems is very often advantageously described in terms of physically well-adapted curvilinear coordinates. It is rather easy to show that the numerous analytical expressions of the kinetic energy operator of a molecular system described in terms of n curvilinear coordinates can all be transformed into the following more usable expression: (T) over cap=Sigma(ij)f(2)(ij)(q)partial derivative(2)/partial derivativeq(i)partial derivativeq(j)+Sigma(i)f(1)(i)(q)partial derivative/partial derivativeq(i)+nu(q), where f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) are functions of the curvilinear coordinates q=(...,q(i),...). If the advantages of curvilinear coordinates are unquestionable, they do have a major drawback: the sometimes awful complexity of the analytical expression of the kinetic operator (T) over cap for molecular systems with more than five atoms. Therefore, we develop an algorithm for computing (T) over cap for a given value of the n curvilinear coordinates q. The calculation of the functions f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) only requires the knowledge of the Cartesian coordinates and their derivatives in terms of the n curvilinear coordinates. This coordinate transformation (curvilinear-->Cartesian) is very easy to perform and is widely used in quantum chemistry codes resorting to a Z-matrix to define the curvilinear coordinates. Thus, the functions f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) can be evaluated numerically and exactly for a given value of q, which makes it possible to propagate wavepackets or to simulate the spectra of rather complex systems (constrained Hamiltonian). The accuracy of this numerical procedure is tested by comparing two calculations of the bending spectrum of HCN: the first one, performed by using the present numerical kinetic operator procedure, the second one, obtained in previous studies, by using an analytical kinetic operator. Finally, the ab initio computation of the internal rotation spectrum and wave functions of 2-methylpropanal by means of dimensionality reduction, is given as an original application.},

  Abstract                 = {A general approach to obtain symmetry adapted bases from a local set of states is presented. The approach is based on the identification of the invariant subspaces which, when projected by means of the eigenfunction method developed by Chen (1989, Group Representation Theory for Physicists Singapore, World Scientific), allow the generation of a symmetry adapted basis. The symmetrized functions so obtained are further taken as a basis to diagonalize simultaneously a set of normal number operators, which provides a set of normal states expanded in terms of the symmetry adapted local basis. In this approach the normal number operators are generated implicitly from the one quantum space through a tensorial formalism. Although the normal operators are defined in a harmonic basis, the locality of the basis allows the approach to be extended to anharmonic functions. This approach has the additional advantage of allowing the elimination of the spurious states, a common problem in a local coordinate representation. An important advantage of this symmetrization method is that it allows generation of a code to analyse any molecular system with a minimum set of input data.},

  Abstract                 = {A general approach to obtain symmetry adapted bases from a local set of states is presented. The approach is based on the identification of the invariant subspaces which, when projected by means of the eigenfunction method developed by Chen (1989, Group Representation Theory for Physicists Singapore, World Scientific), allow the generation of a symmetry adapted basis. The symmetrized functions so obtained are further taken as a basis to diagonalize simultaneously a set of normal number operators, which provides a set of normal states expanded in terms of the symmetry adapted local basis. In this approach the normal number operators are generated implicitly from the one quantum space through a tensorial formalism. Although the normal operators are defined in a harmonic basis, the locality of the basis allows the approach to be extended to anharmonic functions. This approach has the additional advantage of allowing the elimination of the spurious states, a common problem in a local coordinate representation. An important advantage of this symmetrization method is that it allows generation of a code to analyse any molecular system with a minimum set of input data.},

It is shown that in cases when the wave function does not satisfy the Hellmann--Feynman theorem (e.g., limited CI) not only the \{NHF\} correction may be very large, but what is more important, the elements of static polarizability tensors (α,β,γ, etc.) obtained via the dipole expansion are non-physical because they do not satisfy the Kleinman symmetry, and for example αijD≠αjiD, βijjD≠βjjiD or γiijjD=γijjiD≠γjjiiD (for i≠j, i=x,y,z).

  Abstract                 = {{We present two discrete variable representation (DVR) based methods for
 the determination of the vibrational energy levels of tetratomic
 molecules. Both methods are designed for orthogonal internal coordinates
 in a body-fixed reference frame and make use of the DVR of three angular
 variables. The angular DVRs allow the construction of a fixed-angle
 three-mode Hamiltonian for the stretching vibrations. For each of the
 angular triples, the stretching eigenvalue problems are solved by
 employing 3D radial DVRs in the DVR(6) approach and real
 three-dimensional distributed Gaussian functions in the DVR(3) + DGB
 method. The angular degrees of freedom are taken sequentially into
 account in conjunction with a contraction scheme resulting from several
 diagonalization/truncation steps. Vibrationally averaged geometries,
 expectation values of rotational constants, and several adiabatic
 projection schemes developed in this work for tetratomic molecules are
 used to characterize the vibrational levels calculated by the DVR(6) and
 DVR(3) + DGB.}},

 energy levels of formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The discrete
 variable representations of the radial and angular coordinates are
 employed together with the contraction scheme resulting from several
 diagonalization/truncation steps. The global potential energy surface
 due to Carter et al. {[}J. Mol. Spectrosc. 90 (1997) 729] is used for
 H,CO and due to Koput et al. {[}J. Phys. Chem. A 102 (1998) 6325] for
 H2O2. For both molecules, the calculated vibrational energy levels are
 characterized by combining vibrationally averaged geometries and
 expectation values of rotational constants with several adiabatic
 projection schemes for automatic quantum number assignments. The energy
 levels of H,CO involving the excited v, and v, vibrations appear as
 resonances beyond the zero-order picture consisting of uncoupled 3D
 stretching and 2D bending modes. The torsional energy levels of H2O2 are
 studied in great detail and different energy patterns occurring below
 and above the cis barrier are discussed. Our full dimensional
 calculations for H2O2 have shown that the OH triad levels, 2nu(OH), are
 symmetry adapted local mode states. }},

  Abstract                 = {{Correlation consistent basis sets for accurately describing core--core and core--valence correlation effects in atoms and molecules have been developed for the second row atoms Al--Ar. Two different optimization strategies were investigated, which led to two families of core--valence basis sets when the optimized functions were added to the standard correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVnZ). In the first case, the exponents of the augmenting primitive Gaussian functions were optimized with respect to the difference between all-electron and valence--electron correlated calculations, i.e., for the core--core plus core--valence correlation energy. This yielded the cc-pCVnZ family of basis sets, which are analogous to the sets developed previously for the first row atoms [D. E. Woon and T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 103, 4572 (1995)]. Although the cc-pCVnZ sets exhibit systematic convergence to the all-electron correlation energy at the complete basis set limit, the intershell (core--valence) correlation energy converges more slowly than the intrashell (core--core) correlation energy. Since the effect of including the core electrons on the calculation of molecular properties tends to be dominated by core--valence correlation effects, a second scheme for determining the augmenting functions was investigated. In this approach, the exponents of the functions to be added to the cc-pVnZ sets were optimized with respect to just the core--valence (intershell) correlation energy, except that a small amount of core--core correlation energy was included in order to ensure systematic convergence to the complete basis set limit. These new sets, denoted weighted core--valence basis sets (cc-pwCVnZ), significantly improve the convergence of many molecular properties with n. Optimum cc-pwCVnZ sets for the first-row atoms were also developed and show similar advantages. Both the cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ basis sets were benchmarked in coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations on a series of second row homonuclear diatomic molecules (Al2, Si2, P2, S2, and Cl2), as well as on selected diatomic molecules involving first row atoms (CO, SiO, PN, and BCl).

 levels of a triatomic molecule from a kinetic energy operator (KEO) with
 the z axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. We use rotational basis
 functions which are linear combinations of symmetric top functions so
 that all matrix elements are real. For some molecules, coupling between
 rotation and vibration is less important if the z axis is chosen
 perpendicular to the molecular plane, but the singularities of the
 z-axis operator are more difficult to deal with than those of the
 commonly used y-axis operator. The KEO with z axis perpendicular to the
 plane also reduces the number of sums over vibrational indices required
 to evaluate Hamiltonian matrix-vector products. Using a new
 symmetry-adapted basis and the z-axis KEO we calculate rovibrational
 energy levels of H2O for high J values. Even at J=40 we do not observe
 the formation of fourfold clusters. }},

The significant reduction in the size of the \{VCI\} basis obtained using the \{VCIPSI\} scheme does not affect the quality of the computed vibrational frequencies and reduces computational time dramatically. },

  Abstract                 = {We adapt a variation--perturbation method to perform vibrational configuration interaction (VCI) calculations on large molecular systems. Starting from a self-consistent vibrational wave function, we use the vibrational configuration interaction with perturbation selected interactions (VCIPSI) algorithm to select an active \{VCI\} space iteratively. We then extend this approach to use a reduced-coupling description of potential energy surfaces. The accuracy of the method is tested on methane and benzoic acid molecules. The significant reduction in the size of the \{VCI\} basis obtained using the \{VCIPSI\} scheme does not affect the quality of the computed vibrational frequencies and reduces computational time dramatically. },

By combining this with fast-VSCF, an efficient direct evaluation of the ab initio potential-energy surface (PES), we introduce a general formalism for the computation of vibrational bound states of molecular systems exhibiting large-amplitude motion such as methyl-group torsion. We validate our approach on an analytical two-dimensional model and apply it to the methanol molecule. We show that curvilinear coordinates lead to a significant improvement in the VSCF/VCI description of the torsional frequency in methanol, even for a simple two-mode coupling expansion of the PES. Moreover, we demonstrate that a curvilinear formulation of the fast-VSCF/VCI scheme improves its speed by a factor of two and its accuracy by a factor of 3.},

Furthermore, the relations connecting orthonormal bases and the corresponding Lagrange bases are generalized to relations connecting nonorthogonal, regularized bases and the corresponding nonorthogonal, regularized Lagrange bases.},

The results for CH 4 are particularly unusual with four excited states with no dipole-allowed decay route and several others, where these decays lead to exceptionally long lifetimes. These lifetime data should be useful in models of masers and estimates of critical densities, and can provide a link with laboratory measurements.

 solved, numerically exactly, by using a nested contracted basis.
 Rovibrational wavefunctions are computed in a vertical bar v >vertical
 bar J K M > basis, where vertical bar v > is a vibrational wavefunction
 and vertical bar JKM > is a symmetric top wavefunction. In turn, the
 vertical bar v > are obtained by solving a vibrational Schrodinger
 equation with basis functions that are products of contracted bend and
 stretch functions. At all stages of the calculation we exploit parity
 symmetry. The calculations are done in internal coordinates that
 facilitate the treatment of large amplitude motion. An Eckart
 molecule-fixed frame is used by numerically computing coefficients of
 the kinetic energy operator. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated
 by calculating a large number of converged J = 10 methane rovibrational
 levels in the Tetradecad polyad. No previous calculation of
 rovibrational levels of methane includes as many levels as we report in

 is the fact that one can prune the basis: many DVR functions can be
 discarded from the original direct product basis. This significantly
 reduces the cost of the calculation. We have implemented a mapping
 procedure to exploit this prune-ability. We explain how to treat
 Coriolis terms in a parity-adapted basis. The method is tested by

For the aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z series the convergence of the MP2 correlation contribution to the dipole moment is studied.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Duo is a general, user-friendly program for computing rotational, rovibrational and rovibronic spectra of diatomic molecules. Duo solves the Schrödinger equation for the motion of the nuclei not only for the simple case of uncoupled, isolated electronic states (typical for the ground state of closed-shell diatomics) but also for the general case of an arbitrary number and type of couplings between electronic states (typical for open-shell diatomics and excited states). Possible couplings include spin–orbit, angular momenta, spin-rotational and spin–spin. Corrections due to non-adiabatic effects can be accounted for by introducing the relevant couplings using so-called Born–Oppenheimer breakdown curves. Duo requires user-specified potential energy curves and, if relevant, dipole moment, coupling and correction curves. From these it computes energy levels, line positions and line intensities. Several analytic forms plus interpolation and extrapolation options are available for representation of the curves. Duo can refine potential energy and coupling curves to best reproduce reference data such as experimental energy levels or line positions. Duo is provided as a Fortran 2003 program and has been tested under a variety of operating systems.

  Abstract                 = {We present a new computational method with associated computer program TROVE (Theoretical ROVibrational Energies) to perform variational calculations of rovibrational energies for general polyatomic molecules of arbitrary structure in isolated electronic states. The (approximate) nuclear kinetic energy operator is represented as an expansion in terms of internal coordinates. The main feature of the computational scheme is a numerical construction of the kinetic energy operator, which is an integral part of the computation process. Thus the scheme is self-contained, i.e., it requires no analytical pre-derivation of the kinetic energy operator. It is also general, since it can be used in connection with any internal coordinates. The method represents an extension of our model for pyramidal XY3 molecules reported previously {[}S.N. Yurchenko, M. Carvajal, P. Jensen, H. Lin, J.J. Zheng, W. Thiel, Mol. Phys. 103 (2005) 359]. Non-rigid molecules are treated in the Hougen-Bunker-Johns approach {[}J.T. Hougen, P.R. Bunker, J.W.C. Johns, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 34 (1970) 136]. In this case, the variational calculations employ a numerical finite basis representation for the large-amplitude motion using basis functions that are generated by Numerov-Cooley integration of the appropriate one-dimensional Schrodinger equation.

  Abstract                 = {We present a new computational method with associated computer program TROVE (Theoretical ROVibrational Energies) to perform variational calculations of rovibrational energies for general polyatomic molecules of arbitrary structure in isolated electronic states. The (approximate) nuclear kinetic energy operator is represented as an expansion in terms of internal coordinates. The main feature of the computational scheme is a numerical construction of the kinetic energy operator, which is an integral part of the computation process. Thus the scheme is self-contained, i.e., it requires no analytical pre-derivation of the kinetic energy operator. It is also general, since it can be used in connection with any internal coordinates. The method represents an extension of our model for pyramidal XY3 molecules reported previously {[}S.N. Yurchenko, M. Carvajal, P. Jensen, H. Lin, J.J. Zheng, W. Thiel, Mol. Phys. 103 (2005) 359]. Non-rigid molecules are treated in the Hougen-Bunker-Johns approach {[}J.T. Hougen, P.R. Bunker, J.W.C. Johns, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 34 (1970) 136]. In this case, the variational calculations employ a numerical finite basis representation for the large-amplitude motion using basis functions that are generated by Numerov-Cooley integration of the appropriate one-dimensional Schrodinger equation.
