Abstract = {{The state of the art analyses of high-resolution ozone spectra and a
   critical discussion of line parameters updated since the previous review
   by Rinsland et al. {[}J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transfer 2003;82:207-18]
   are presented. We focus on recent works revisiting improved measurements
   and analyses of Fourier transform spectra below 5600 cm(-1) and review
   Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy measurements and analyses in the 5850-7920
   cm(-1) spectral region which have been performed for O-16(3) and all
   O-18 enriched ozone isotopologues. Various issues related to resonance
   perturbations due to dark states are discussed as well as the issues
   concerning the accuracy of the experimental parameters, the data
   modelling and the data reduction. Comparisons of vibration levels
   determined from spectra analyses with predictions from the molecular
   potential functions are given. The procedures of empirical corrections
   for calculated line lists are described and the ``intricate{''} question
   of absolute intensity determination is overviewed. Also, a review of
   deficiencies, challenge for improvements, and related works in progress
   are reported. }},

Title = {{Calculated vibrational states of ozone up to dissociation}},
Journal = JCP,

Abstract = {{A new accurate global potential energy surface for the ground electronic
   state of ozone {[}R. Dawes et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 201103 (2013)]
   was published fairly recently. The topography near dissociation differs
   significantly from previous surfaces, without spurious submerged reefs
   and corresponding van der Waals wells. This has enabled significantly
   improved descriptions of scattering processes, capturing the negative
   temperature dependence and large kinetic isotope effects in exchange
   reaction rates. The exchange reactivity was found to depend on the
   character of near-threshold resonances and their overlap with reactant
   and product wavefunctions, which in turn are sensitive to the potential.
   Here we present global ``three-well{''} calculations of all bound
   vibrational states of three isotopic combinations of ozone (O-48(3),
   (O2O)-O-16-O-18, (O2O)-O-16-O-17) for J = 0 and J = 1 with a focus on
   the character and density of highly excited states and discuss their
   impact on the ozone isotopic anomaly. The calculations were done using a
   parallel symmetry-adapted Lanczos method with the RV3 code. Some
   comparisons were made with results obtained with the improved relaxation
   method implemented in the Heidelberg multi-configuration time-dependent
   Hartree code. }},
