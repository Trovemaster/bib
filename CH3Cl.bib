Abstract = {The vibrational levels for two isotopic species of methyl chloride have
   been calculated in the region 03500 cm(-1) from the ab initio potential
   energy surface (PES). The isotopic shift of vibrational levels of
   molecules (CH3Cl)-C-12-Cl-35 and (CH3Cl)-C-12-Cl-37 has been calculated.
   The correlation consistent basis sets cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ are employed
   to calculate energy values for 7957 and 3758 points correspondingly from
   a large domain of the nine-dimensional internal coordinate space. The
   analytic global PES is fitted with the standard deviation of 4.5 cm(-1).

   10(-26)-10(-27) cm/molecule and have been measured by utilizing
   commercial AlGaAs/GaAs laser diodes through the wavelength modulation
   spectroscopy (WMS) and the 2nd harmonic (2j) detection techniques. For

   title = {Accurate ab initio vibrational energies of methyl chloride},
   journal = JCP,

   number = {24},
   abstract = {Two new nine-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) have been generated using high-level ab initio theory for the two main isotopologues of methyl chloride, (CH3Cl)-Cl-35 and (CH3Cl)-Cl-37. The respective PESs, CBS-35(HL), and CBS-37(HL), are based on explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit, and incorporate a range of higher-level (HL) additive energy corrections to account for core-valence electron correlation, higher-order coupled cluster terms, scalar relativistic effects, and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections. Variational calculations of the vibrational energy levels were performed using the computer program TROVE, whose functionality has been extended to handle molecules of the form XY(3)Z. Fully converged energies were obtained by means of a complete vibrational basis set extrapolation. The CBS-35(HL) and CBS-37(HL) PESs reproduce the fundamental term values with root-mean-square errors of 0.75 and 1.00 cm(-1), respectively. An analysis of the combined effect of the HL corrections and CBS extrapolation on the vibrational wavenumbers indicates that both are needed to compute accurate theoretical results for methyl chloride. We believe that it would be extremely challenging to go beyond the accuracy currently achieved for CH3Cl without empirical refinement of the respective PESs. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

for 12CH335Cl and 12CH337Cl were retrieved from the Fourier transform spectra in the range of 
1900-2600 cm-1. Line intensities were scaled with measurements from literature. Measured line positions and intensities were treated using global effective Hamiltonian and dipole moment model. The \{RMS\} of intensity fitting was 7.4% for 12CH335Cl and 6.6% for 12CH337Cl. List of positions and intensities were calculated for 22,098 and 21,014 lines between 1900 and 2600 cm-1 for 12CH335Cl and 12CH337Cl, respectively. Updated intensities allow extending assignments. The new line list of positions and intensities for both isotopologues in this spectral region was calculated. The calculations from the line list of this work have been compared with values from the \{HITRAN2012\} database and \{PNNL\} spectra. }
