	directly provide the experimental information needed to understand
	the large amplitude motion of the molecule. Literature ab initio
	calculations show that the large amplitude motion of the five protons
	around the central carbon nucleus in CH is not completely free, but
	is restricted by potential barriers at the trigonal bipyramid (D-3h),
	square pyramid (C-4v) and end-on-H-2 (C-3v) forms. Thus, the large
	amplitude motion proceeds mostly in the coordinate space that connects
	the structures called C-s(I), C-s(II) and C-2v. These structures
	have essentially identical electronic energies and very similar rotational
	constants, as has already been shown in the literature. We calculate
	that they also have very similar dipole moments. The topology of

	the CCSD(T) results for the aug-cc-pVXZ(X=T,Q,5) basis sets to the
	complete basis set (CBS) limit and adding corrections for core-valence
	correlation and relativistic effects. CBS{*}{*} ab initio energies
	are generated at 51 816 geometries by an empirical extrapolation
	of the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ results to the CBS+ limit. They cover
	the energy region up to 20 000 cm(-1) above equilibrium. Parametrized
	analytical functions are fitted through the ab initio points. For
	these analytical surfaces, vibrational term values and transition
	moments are calculated by means of a variational program employing
	a kinetic-energy operator expressed in the Eckart-Sayvetz frame.
	Comparisons against experiment are used to assess the quality of
	the generated potential-energy surfaces. A ``spectroscopic{''} potential-energy
	surface of {NH$_3$} is determined by a slight empirical adjustment of
	the ab initio potential to the experimental vibrational term values.

	the range 0.5-10 mu m can be covered. Due to the low level of activity
	of GJ436, the effect of starspots on the combination of transits

	Representative climate models were calculated by using a three-dimensional,
	pseudospectral general circulation model with idealized thermal forcing.
	Simulated transit spectra of GJ436b were generated using line-by-line

	In the past ten years, we have learned how to obtain the first spectra
	of exoplanets using transit transmission and emission spectroscopy.
	With the high stability of Spitzer, Hubble, and large ground-based
	telescopes the spectra of bright close-in massive planets can be
	obtained and species like water vapour, methane, carbon monoxide
	and dioxide have been detected. With transit science came the first
	tangible remote sensing of these planetary bodies and so one can
	start to extrapolate from what has been learnt from Solar System
	probes to what one might plan to learn about their faraway siblings.
	As we learn more about the atmospheres, surfaces and near-surfaces
	of these remote bodies, we will begin to build up a clearer picture
	of their construction, history and suitability for life. The Exoplanet
	Characterisation Observatory, EChO, will be the first dedicated mission
	to investigate the physics and chemistry of Exoplanetary Atmospheres.
	By characterising spectroscopically more bodies in different environments
	we will take detailed planetology out of the Solar System and into
	the Galaxy as a whole. EChO has now been selected by the European
	Space Agency to be assessed as one of four M3 mission candidates.},

	by placing our Solar System in context and by addressing the suitability
	of planets for the presence of life. EChO-the Exoplanet Characterisation
	Observatory-is a mission concept specifically geared for this purpose.
	EChO will provide simultaneous, multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations
	on a stable platform that will allow very long exposures. The use
	of passive cooling, few moving parts and well established technology
	gives a low-risk and potentially long-lived mission. EChO will build
	on observations by Hubble, Spitzer and ground-based telescopes, which
	discovered the first molecules and atoms in exoplanetary atmospheres.
	However, EChO's configuration and specifications are designed to
	study a number of systems in a consistent manner that will eliminate
	the ambiguities affecting prior observations. EChO will simultaneously
	observe a broad enough spectral region-from the visible to the mid-infrared-to
	constrain from one single spectrum the temperature structure of the
	atmosphere, the abundances of the major carbon and oxygen bearing
	species, the expected photochemically-produced species and magnetospheric
	signatures. The spectral range and resolution are tailored to separate
	bands belonging to up to 30 molecules and retrieve the composition
	and temperature structure of planetary atmospheres. The target list
	for EChO includes planets ranging from Jupiter-sized with equilibrium
	temperatures T (eq) up to 2,000 K, to those of a few Earth masses,
	with T (eq) \textbackslash{}u223c 300 K. The list will include planets
	with no Solar System analog, such as the recently discovered planets
	GJ1214b, whose density lies between that of terrestrial and gaseous
	planets, or the rocky-iron planet 55 Cnc e, with day-side temperature
	close to 3,000 K. As the number of detected exoplanets is growing
	rapidly each year, and the mass and radius of those detected steadily
	decreases, the target list will be constantly adjusted to include
	the most interesting systems. We have baselined a dispersive spectrograph
	design covering continuously the 0.4-16 mu m spectral range in 6
	channels (1 in the visible, 5 in the InfraRed), which allows the
	spectral resolution to be adapted from several tens to several hundreds,
	depending on the target brightness. The instrument will be mounted
	behind a 1.5 m class telescope, passively cooled to 50 K, with the
	instrument structure and optics passively cooled to \textbackslash{}u223c45
	K. EChO will be placed in a grand halo orbit around L2. This orbit,
	in combination with an optimised thermal shield design, provides
	a highly stable thermal environment and a high degree of visibility
	of the sky to observe repeatedly several tens of targets over the
	year. Both the baseline and alternative designs have been evaluated
	and no critical items with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) less
	than 4-5 have been identified. We have also undertaken a first-order
	cost and development plan analysis and find that EChO is easily compatible
	with the ESA M-class mission framework.},

	continuum source using a Fourier transform spectrometer located at

	of the four isotopologues (H2S)-S-32, (H2S)-S-33, (H2S)-S-34, and
	(H2S)-S-36 observed in natural abundance. 65\% of these lines are
	recorded and assigned for the first time, sampling levels as high
	as J=26 and K-a=17 for (H2S)-S-32. 320 pure rotational transitions
	of (H2S)-S-32 in its first excited bending vibrational state are
	recorded and analysed for the first time and 86 transitions for (H2S)-S-34,
	where some of these transitions belong to new experimental energy
	levels. Rotational constants have been fitted for all the isotopologues
	in both vibrational states using a standard effective Hamiltonian
	approach. Comprehensive comparisons are made with previously available
	data as well as the data available in HITRAN, CDMS, and JPL databases.
	The 91 transitions assigned to (H2S)-S-36 give the first proper characterization

	using the coupled cluster method with single and double substitutions

We use the transition intensities from the HITRAN database of 14 vibrational bands for our comparisons. The intensities of all fundamental bands show strong sensitivity to the ab initio method used for constructing the DMS while hot, overtone and combination bands up to 4000 cm(-1) do not. The core-correlation and relativistic effects are found to be important for computed line intensities, for instance affecting the most intense fundamental band (v(2)) by about 20%. Our recommended DMS, called ALYT2, is based on the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z level of theory supplemented by a core-correlation/relativistic corrective surface obtained at the CCSD[T]/aug-cc-pCV5Z-DK level. The corresponding computed intensities agree significantly better (to within 10%) with experimental data taken directly from original papers. Worse agreement (differences of about 25%) is found for those HITRAN intensities obtained from fitted effective dipole models, suggesting the presence of underlying problems in those fits.

Out of the 29 450 measured transitions 10 041 and 18 947 belong to ortho- and para-(NH3)-N-14, respectively. A careful analysis of the related experimental spectroscopic network (SN) allows 28 530 of the measured transitions to be validated, 18 178 of these are unique, while 462 transitions belong to floating components. Despite the large number of spectroscopic measurements published over the last 80 years, the transitions determine only 30 vibrational band origins of (NH3)-N-14, 8 for ortho- and 22 for para-(NH3)-N-14. The highest J value, where J stands for the rotational quantum number, for which an energy level is validated is 31. The number of experimental-quality ortho- and para-(NH3)-N-14 rovibrational energy levels is 1724 and 3237, respectively. The MARVEL energy levels are checked against ones in the BYTe first-principles database, determined previously. The lists of validated lines and levels for (NH3)-N-14 are deposited in the Supporting Information to this paper. Combination of the MARVEL energy levels with first-principles absorption intensities yields a huge number of experimental-quality rovibrational lines, which should prove to be useful for the understanding of future complex high-resolution spectroscopy on (NH3)-N-14; these lines are also deposited in the Supporting Information to this paper.

   abstract = {A comprehensive hot line list is calculated for (PH3)-P-31 in its ground electronic state. This line list, called SAlTY, contains almost 16.8 billion transitions between 7.5 million energy levels and it is suitable for simulating spectra up to temperatures of 1500 K. It covers wavelengths longer than 1 mu m and includes all transitions to upper states with energies below hc x 18 000 cm(-1) and rotational excitation up to J = 46. The line list is computed by variational solution of the Schrodinger equation for the rotation-vibration motion employing the nuclear-motion program TROVE. A previously reported ab initio dipole moment surface is used as well as an updated 'spectroscopic' potential energy surface, obtained by refining an existing ab initio surface through least-squares fitting to the experimentally derived energies. Detailed comparisons with other available sources of phosphine transitions confirms SAlTY's accuracy and illustrates the incompleteness of previous experimental and theoretical compilations for temperatures above 300 K. Atmospheric models are expected to severely underestimate the abundance of phosphine in disequilibrium environments, and it is predicted that phosphine will be detectable in the upper troposphere of many substellar objects. This list is suitable for modelling atmospheres of many astrophysical environments, namely carbon stars, Y dwarfs, T dwarfs, hot Jupiters and Solar system gas giant planets.

We here present a novel inverse retrieval code for exoplanetary atmospheres. tau-REx(Tau Retrieval for Exoplanets) is a line-by-line radiative transfer fully Bayesian retrieval framework. tau-REx includes the following features:(1) the optimized use of molecular line lists from the ExoMol project; (2) an unbiased atmospheric composition prior selection, through custom built pattern recognition software; (3) the use of two independent algorithms to fully sample the Bayesian likelihood space: nested sampling as well as a more classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach; (4) iterative Bayesian parameter and model selection using the full Bayesian Evidence as well as the Savage-Dickey Ratio for nested models; and (5) the ability to fully map very large parameter spaces through optimal code parallelization and scalability to cluster computing. In this publication we outline the tau-REx framework and demonstrate, using a theoretical hot-Jupiter transmission spectrum, the parameter retrieval and model selection. We investigate the impact of signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution on the retrievability of individual model parameters, both in terms of error bars on the temperature and molecular mixing ratios as well as its effect on the model's global Bayesian evidence.},

   abstract = {T-REx (Tau Retrieval of Exoplanets) is a novel, fully Bayesian atmospheric retrieval code custom built for extrasolar atmospheres. In Waldmann et al., the transmission spectroscopic case was introduced, and here we present the emission spectroscopy spectral retrieval for the T-REx framework. Compared to transmission spectroscopy, the emission case is often significantly more degenerate due to the need to retrieve the full atmospheric temperature-pressure (TP) profile. This is particularly true in the case of current measurements of exoplanetary atmospheres, which are either of low signal-to-noise, low spectral resolution, or both. We present a new way of combining two existing approaches to the modeling of the said TP profile: (1) the parametric profile, where the atmospheric TP structure is analytically approximated by a few model parameters, (2) the layer-by-layer approach, where individual atmospheric layers are modeled. Both of these approaches have distinct advantages and disadvantages in terms of convergence properties and potential model biases. The T-REx hybrid model presented here is a new two-stage TP profile retrieval, which combines the robustness of the analytic solution with the accuracy of the layer-by-layer approach. The retrieval process is demonstrated using simulations of the hot-Jupiter WASP-76b and the hot-super-Earth 55 Cnc e as well as the secondary eclipse measurements of HD 189733b.},

Abstract = {Rotation-vibration spectra of the nitric acid molecule, HNO3(,) are

   using a Hamiltonian expressed in internal curvilinear vibrational
   coordinates employing a hybrid variational-perturbation method. An

   are calculated ab initio at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ level of theory.
   Parameters of the PES and DMF are varied to minimize differences between
   the calculated and experimental transition frequencies and intensities.
   The average, absolute deviation between calculated and experimental
   values is 0.2 cm(-1) for frequencies in the fundamental bands and 0.4
   cm(-1) for those in the first overtone and lowest combination bands. For
   the intensities, the calculated and experimental values differ by 0.3\%
   and 40\% for the fundamentals and overtones, respectively. The optimized

   spectrum. These calculation reproduce both the form of the absorption
   bands and fine details of the observed spectra, including the rotational
   structure of the vibrational bands and the numerous hot absorption band.

The expansion of the kinetic energy operator of an arbitrary order is obtained numerically using an automatic differentiation (AD) technique. The method is applicable to molecules of arbitrary size and structure and is flexible for choosing various types of internal coordinates. A new way of solving the Eckart-frame equations for curvilinear coordinates also based on the AD technique is presented. The resulting accuracy of the high-order expansion coefficients for the kinetic energy operator using our numerical technique is comparable to that obtained by symbolic differentiation, with the advantage of being faster and less demanding in memory. Examples for H2CO, NH3, PH3, and CH3Cl molecules demonstrate the advantages of the curvilinear internal coordinates and the Eckart molecular frame for accurate ro-vibrational calculations. Our results show that very high accuracy and quick convergence can be achieved even with moderate expansions if curvilinear coordinates are employed, which is important for applications involving large polyatomic molecules.},

   abstract = {Two new nine-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) have been generated using high-level ab initio theory for the two main isotopologues of methyl chloride, (CH3Cl)-Cl-35 and (CH3Cl)-Cl-37. The respective PESs, CBS-35(HL), and CBS-37(HL), are based on explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit, and incorporate a range of higher-level (HL) additive energy corrections to account for core-valence electron correlation, higher-order coupled cluster terms, scalar relativistic effects, and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections. Variational calculations of the vibrational energy levels were performed using the computer program TROVE, whose functionality has been extended to handle molecules of the form XY(3)Z. Fully converged energies were obtained by means of a complete vibrational basis set extrapolation. The CBS-35(HL) and CBS-37(HL) PESs reproduce the fundamental term values with root-mean-square errors of 0.75 and 1.00 cm(-1), respectively. An analysis of the combined effect of the HL corrections and CBS extrapolation on the vibrational wavenumbers indicates that both are needed to compute accurate theoretical results for methyl chloride. We believe that it would be extremely challenging to go beyond the accuracy currently achieved for CH3Cl without empirical refinement of the respective PESs. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

year= {"2015},
volume= {"40},

pages= {"329--391},
abstract= {"The discovery of almost two thousand exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverse planet population. We see gas giants in few-day orbits, whole multi-planet systems within the orbit of Mercury, and new populations of planets with masses between that of the Earth and Neptune---all unknown in the Solar System. Observations to date have shown that our Solar System is certainly not representative of the general population of planets in our Milky Way. The key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore: What are exoplanets made of? Why are planets as they are? How do planetary systems work and what causes the exceptional diversity observed as compared to the Solar System? The EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory) space mission was conceived to take up the challenge to explain this diversity in terms of formation, evolution, internal structure and planet and atmospheric composition. This requires in-depth spectroscopic knowledge of the atmospheres of a large and well-defined planet sample for which precise physical, chemical and dynamical information can be obtained. In order to fulfil this ambitious scientific program, EChO was designed as a dedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable of observing a large, diverse and well-defined planet sample within its 4-year mission lifetime. The transit and eclipse spectroscopy method, whereby the signal from the star and planet are differentiated using knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, allows us to measure atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of at least 10-4 relative to the star. This can only be achieved in conjunction with a carefully designed stable payload and satellite platform. It is also necessary to provide broad instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect as many molecular species as possible, to probe the thermal structure of the planetary atmospheres and to correct for the contaminating effects of the stellar photosphere. This requires wavelength coverage of at least 0.55 to 11$\mu$m with a goal of covering from 0.4 to 16$\mu$m. Only modest spectral resolving power is needed, with R\thinspace{\textasciitilde}\thinspace300 for wavelengths less than 5$\mu$m and R\thinspace{\textasciitilde}\thinspace30 for wavelengths greater than this. The transit spectroscopy technique means that no spatial resolution is required. A telescope collecting area of about 1m2 is sufficiently large to achieve the necessary spectro-photometric precision: for the Phase A study a 1.13m2 telescope, diffraction limited at 3$\mu$m has been adopted. Placing the satellite at L2 provides a cold and stable thermal environment as well as a large field of regard to allow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed over the sky. EChO has been conceived to achieve a single goal: exoplanet spectroscopy. The spectral coverage and signal-to-noise to be achieved by EChO, thanks to its high stability and dedicated design, would be a game changer by allowing atmospheric composition to be measured with unparalleled exactness: at least a factor 10 more precise and a factor 10 to 1000 more accurate than current observations. This would enable the detection of molecular abundances three orders of magnitude lower than currently possible and a fourfold increase from the handful of molecules detected to date. Combining these data with estimates of planetary bulk compositions from accurate measurements of their radii and masses would allow degeneracies associated with planetary interior modelling to be broken, giving unique insight into the interior structure and elemental abundances of these alien worlds. EChO would allow scientists to study exoplanets both as a population and as individuals. The mission can target super-Earths, Neptune-like, and Jupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperatures of 300--3000K) of F to M-type host stars. The EChO core science would be delivered by a three-tier survey. The EChO Chemical Census: This is a broad survey of a few-hundred exoplanets, which allows us to explore the spectroscopic and chemical diversity of the exoplanet population as a whole. The EChO Origin: This is a deep survey of a subsample of tens of exoplanets for which significantly higher signal to noise and spectral resolution spectra can be obtained to explain the origin of the exoplanet diversity (such as formation mechanisms, chemical processes, atmospheric escape). The EChO Rosetta Stones: This is an ultra-high accuracy survey targeting a subsample of select exoplanets. These will be the bright ``benchmark'' cases for which a large number of measurements would be taken to explore temporal variations, and to obtain two and three dimensional spatial information on the atmospheric conditions through eclipse-mapping techniques. If EChO were launched today, the exoplanets currently observed are sufficient to provide a large and diverse sample. The Chemical Census survey would consist of\thinspace>\thinspace160 exoplanets with a range of planetary sizes, temperatures, orbital parameters and stellar host properties. Additionally, over the next 10years, several new ground- and space-based transit photometric surveys and missions will come on-line (e.g. NGTS, CHEOPS, TESS, PLATO), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems. The current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be further optimised in the years prior to EChO's launch and enable the atmospheric characterisation of hundreds of planets.},

Results are presented for SiO, CaH, AlO, ScH, H 2 O and methane. The results for CH 4 are particularly unusual with four excited states with no dipole-allowed decay route and several others, where these decays lead to exceptionally long lifetimes. These lifetime data should be useful in models of masers and estimates of critical densities, and can provide a link with laboratory measurements. Cooling functions are important in stellar and planet formation.}

abstract ={An accurate line list for calcium oxide is presented covering transitions between all bound ro-vibronic levels from the five lowest electronic states X 1 Sigma+, A 1Pi, A 1Sigma+, a 3Pi, and b 3Sigma+. The ro-vibronic energies and corresponding wavefunctions were obtained by solving the fully coupled Schrdinger equation. Ab initio potential energy, spin-orbit, and electronic angular momentum curves were refined by fitting to the experimental frequencies and experimentally derived energies available in the literature. Using our refined model we could (1) reassign the vibronic states for a large portion of the experimentally derived energies (van Groenendael A., Tudorie M., Focsa C., Pinchemel B., Bernath P. F., 2005, J. Mol. Spectrosc., 234, 255), (2) extended this list of energies to J = 61118 and (3) suggest a new description of the resonances from the A 1Sigma+-X 1Sigma+ system. We used high level ab initio electric dipole moments reported previously (Khalil H., Brites V., Le Quere F., Leonard C., 2011, Chem. Phys., 386, 50) to compute the Einstein A coefficients. Our work is the first fully coupled description of this system. Our line list is the most complete catalogue of spectroscopic transitions available for 40Ca16O and is applicable for temperatures up to at least 5000 K. CaO has yet to be observed astronomically but its transitions are characterized by being particularly strong which should facilitate its detection. The CaO line list is made available in an electronic form as supplementary data to this article and at www.exomol.com.},

abstract = {Abstract Duo is a general, user-friendly program for computing rotational, rovibrational and rovibronic spectra of diatomic molecules. Duo solves the Schrdinger equation for the motion of the nuclei not only for the simple case of uncoupled, isolated electronic states (typical for the ground state of closed-shell diatomics) but also for the general case of an arbitrary number and type of couplings between electronic states (typical for open-shell diatomics and excited states). Possible couplings include spinorbit, angular momenta, spin-rotational and spinspin. Corrections due to non-adiabatic effects can be accounted for by introducing the relevant couplings using so-called BornOppenheimer breakdown curves. Duo requires user-specified potential energy curves and, if relevant, dipole moment, coupling and correction curves. From these it computes energy levels, line positions and line intensities. Several analytic forms plus interpolation and extrapolation options are available for representation of the curves. Duo can refine potential energy and coupling curves to best reproduce reference data such as experimental energy levels or line positions. Duo is provided as a Fortran2003 program and has been tested under a variety of operating systems.

   line lists are suitable for temperatures up to 3000 K. A
   spectroscopically-determined potential energy curve (PEC) and dipole
   moment curve (DMC) are taken from literature. This PEC is adapted to
   suit our method prior to the computation of ro-vibrational energies. The
   calculated energies are then substituted by experimental energies, where
   available, to improve the accuracy of the line lists. The ab initio DMC
   is used without refinement to generate Einstein A coefficients. Full
   line lists of vibration-rotation transitions and partition functions are
   made available in an electronic form as Supporting Information to this
   paper and at www.exomol.com.},

Abstract = {High-resolution absorption spectra of NH3 in the region 500-2100 cm(-1)
   at temperatures up to 1027 degrees C and approximately atmospheric
   pressure (1013 +/- 20 mbar) are measured. NH3 concentrations of 1000
   ppm, 0.5\% and 1\% in volume fraction were used in the measurements.
   Spectra are recorded in high temperature gas flow cells using a Fourier
   Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer at a nominal resolution of 0.09
   cm(-1). Measurements at 22.7 degrees C are compared to high-resolution
   cross sections available from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
   (PNNL). The higher temperature spectra are analysed by comparison to a
   variational line list, BYTe, and experimental energy levels determined
   using the MARVEL procedure. Approximately 2000 lines have been assigned,
   of which 851 are newly assigned to mainly hot bands involving
   vibrational states as high as v(2)=5. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier
