abstract = "Abstract Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) is the most sensitive method for quantitation of 14C in biological samples. This technology has been used in a variety of low dose, human health related studies over the last 20 years when very high sensitivity was needed. \{AMS\} helped pioneer these scientific methods, but its expensive facilities and requirements for highly trained technical staff have limited their proliferation. Quantification of 14C by cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) offers an approach that eliminates many of the shortcomings of an accelerator-based system and would supplement the use of \{AMS\} in biomedical research. Our initial prototype, using a non-ideal wavelength laser and under suboptimal experimental conditions, has a 3.5-modern, 1- σ precision for detection of milligram-sized, carbon-14-elevated samples. These results demonstrate proof of principle and provided a starting point for the development of a spectrometer capable of biologically relevant sensitivities. "

Abstract={{We present an atmospheric version, CDSD-296, of the carbon dioxide spectroscopic databank (CDSD). The databank contains the calculated line parameters (positions, intensities, air- and self-broadened half-widths, coefficients of temperature dependence of air-broadened half-widths and air pressure-induced line shifts) of the twelve stable isotopic species of CO 2 . The reference temperature is T ref =296K and the intensity cutoff is I cut =10 −30 cm −1 /(moleculecm −2 ). More than 500,000 lines covering the 6–14,075cm −1 spectral range are included in CDSD-296. The databank has been generated within the framework of the method of effective operators and based on the global weighted fits of spectroscopic parameters (parameters of the effective Hamiltonians and effective dipole moment operators) to observed data collected from the literature. The fitted models are able to reproduce known measured positions and intensities with accuracies compatible with measurement uncertainties. The line-shape parameters originate from the recent theoretical and semi-empirical calculations. Comparisons of CDSD-296 with HITRAN-2012, GEISA-2011, and the AMES line lists are also given.}},

   the four most abundant isotopic species of the carbon dioxide molecule.
   The reference temperature is T-ref = 1000 K and the intensity cutoff is

   covering the 260-8310, 418-2454, 394-4662, and 429-2846 cm(-1) spectral

   CDSD-1000 is able to reproduce observed spectra in a more satisfactory

   radiative properties of CO2. CDSD-1000 is freely accessible via the

   transitions are cut off at 1E-42 cm molecule(-1) (296 K) and 1E-36 cm

   reliably the energy region as high as similar to 20,000 cm(-1). Recent
   experimental data at 1.1 mu m has confirmed the predicted intensities
   for the 50013-00001 and 50014-00001 band transitions have better than

   spectral range and designed for the temperature range 2500-5000 K.
   Format of CDSD-4000 is similar to that of HITRAN-2008. The databank has
   been generated within the framework of the method of effective operators
   and based on the global fittings of spectroscopic parameters (parameters
   of the effective Hamiltonians and effective dipole moment operators) to
   observed data collected from the literature. The databank is useful for

Abstract = {{A scanning differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instrument for

   wavelength. Two in-line fiber optic switches are used to switch between
   online and offline operation. After the fiber optic switch, an
   acousto-optic modulator is used to generate a pulse train used to
   injection seed an erbium-doped fiber amplifier to produce eye-safe laser
   pulses with maximum pulse energies of 66 mu J, a pulse repetition
   frequency of 15 kHz, and an operating wavelength of 1.571 mu m. The DIAL
   receiver uses a 28 cm diameter Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope to collect
   that backscattered light, which is then monitored using a
   photomultiplier tube module operating in the photon counting mode. The
   DIAL has measured carbon dioxide profiles from 1 to 2.5 km with 60 min

Title = {{High-temperature measurements of VUV-absorption cross sections of CO$_2$
   and their application to exoplanets}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{551}},
pages = {A131},
Abstract = {{Context. Ultraviolet (UV) absorption cross sections are an essential
   ingredient of photochemical atmosphere models. Exoplanet searches have
   unveiled a large population of short-period objects with hot
   atmospheres, very different from what we find in our solar system.
   Transiting exoplanets whose atmospheres can now be studied by transit
   spectroscopy receive extremely strong UV fluxes and have typical
   temperatures ranging from 400 to 2500 K. At these temperatures, UV
   photolysis cross section data are severely lacking.
   Aims. Our goal is to provide high-temperature absorption cross sections
   and their temperature dependency for important atmospheric compounds.
   This study is dedicated to CO2, which is observed and photodissociated
   in exoplanet atmospheres. We also investigate the influence of these new
   data on the photochemistry of some exoplanets.
   Methods. We performed these measurements with synchrotron radiation as a
   tunable VUV light source for the 115-200 nm range at 300, 410, 480, and
   550 K. In the 195-230 nm range, we used a deuterium lamp and a 1.5 m
   Jobin-Yvon spectrometer and we worked at seven temperatures between 465
   and 800 K. We implemented the measured cross section into a 1D
   photochemical model.
   Results. For lambda > 170 nm, the wavelength dependence of ln(sigma(CO2)
   (lambda,T) x 1/Q(v)(T)) can be parametrized with a linear law. Thus, we
   can interpolate sigma(CO2) (lambda,T) at any temperature between 300 and
   800 K. Within the studied range of temperature, the CO2 cross section
   can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. This, in particular,
   makes the absorption of CO2 significant up to wavelengths as high as 230
   nm, while it is negligible above 200 nm at 300 K.
   Conclusions. The absorption cross section of CO2 is very sensitive to
   temperature, especially above 160 nm. The model predicts that accounting
   for this temperature dependency of CO2 cross section can affect the
   computed abundances of NH3, CO2, and CO by one order of magnitude in the
   atmospheres of hot Jupiter and hot Neptune. This effect will be more
   important in hot CO2-dominated atmospheres.}},

	energy levels. The purely ab initio PES is denoted Ames-0, while
	the refined PES is denoted Ames-1. Detailed tests are performed to
	demonstrate the spectroscopic accuracy of the Ames-1 PES. It is shown
	that Ames-1 yields sigma(rms) (root-mean-squares error) = 0.0156
	cm(-1) for 6873 J = 0-117 (CO2)-C-12-O-16 experimental energy levels,
	even though less than 500 (CO2)-C-12-O-16 energy levels were included
	in the refinement procedure. It is also demonstrated that, without
	any additional refinement, Ames-1 yields very good agreement for
	isotopologues. Specifically, for the (CO2)-C-12-O-16 and (CO2)-C-13-O-16
	isotopologues, spectroscopic constants G(nu) computed from Ames-1
	are within +/- 0.01 and 0.02 cm(-1) of reliable experimentally derived

	0.10 and 0.15 cm(-1). To our knowledge, this is the first time a

	has led to new challenges in the refinement procedure. An initial

	and used to generate a 296 K line list. For most bands, experimental
	IR intensities are well reproduced for (CO2)-C-12-O-16 using Ames-1
	and the DMS. For more than 80\% of the bands, the experimental intensities
	are reproduced with sigma(rms)(Delta I) < 20\% or srms(Delta I/delta(obs))
	< 5. A few exceptions are analyzed and discussed. Directions for

   repeatability is evaluated based on surveillance cylinders of whole air

   Operationally generated data sets consist of temperature, H2O, O-3, CH4,

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important man-made greenhouse gas (GHG)
   that cause global warming. With electricity generation through
   fossil-fuel power plants now being the economic sector with the largest
   source of CO2, power plant emissions monitoring has become more
   important than ever in the fight against global warming. In a previous
   study done by Bovensmann et al. (2010), random and systematic errors of
   power plant CO2 emissions have been quantified using a single overpass
   from a proposed CarbonSat instrument. In this study, we quantify errors
   of power plant annual emission estimates from a hypothetical CarbonSat
   and constellations of several CarbonSats while taking into account that
   power plant CO2 emissions are time-dependent. Our focus is on estimating
   systematic errors arising from the sparse temporal sampling as well as
   random errors that are primarily dependent on wind speeds. We used
   hourly emissions data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   combined with assimilated and re-analyzed meteorological fields from the
   National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP). CarbonSat orbits
   were simulated as a sun-synchronous low-earth orbiting satellite (LEO)
   with an 828-km orbit height, local time ascending node (LTAN) of 13:30
   (01:30 p.m. LT) and achieves global coverage after 5 days. We show, that
   despite the variability of the power plant emissions and the limited
   satellite overpasses, one CarbonSat has the potential to verify reported
   US annual CO2 emissions from large power plants (>= 5 MtCO(2) yr(-1))
   with a systematic error of less than similar to 4.9\% and a random error
   of less than similar to 6.7\% for 50\% of all the power plants. For 90\%
   of all the power plants, the systematic error was less than similar to
   12.4\% and the random error was less than similar to 13 \%. We
   additionally investigated two different satellite configurations using a
   combination of 5 CarbonSats. One achieves global coverage everyday but
   only samples the targets at fixed local times. The other configuration
   samples the targets five times at two-hour intervals approximately every
   6th day but only achieves global coverage after 5 days. From the
   statistical analyses, we found, as expected, that the random errors
   improve by approximately a factor of two if 5 satellites are used. On
   the other hand, more satellites do not result in a large reduction of
   the systematic error. The systematic error is somewhat smaller for the
   CarbonSat constellation configuration achieving global coverage
   everyday. Therefore, we recommend the CarbonSat constellation
   configuration that achieves daily global coverage.}},

   eventual successors of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO). A purely
   theoretical analysis is first made, based on simulations of atmospheric

   disregarding this process induces significant errors in the calculated
   absorption coefficients, leading to systematic structures in the
   spectral fit residuals and airmass-dependent biases in the retrieved CO2
   amounts. These theoretical predictions are then confirmed by using
   atmospheric solar-absorption spectra measured by a ground-based Fourier
   transform spectrometer. It is first shown that including line mixing in
   the forward model used for the inversion leads to a very significant
   reduction of the residuals in the 2.1 mu m region. Secondly, the
   inclusion of line mixing reduces the dependence of the retrieved CO2 on
   the airmass and greatly improves the consistency between values obtained
   independently from spectra in the 1.6 and 2.1 mu m bands. These results
   open promising prospects for various ground-based and space-borne

   spectrometers used for chemical monitoring of the atmosphere by the
   Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). Good
   ILS knowledge is required for the analysis of the recorded mid-infrared
   spectra. The new method applies a sequence of measurements using
   different gas cells instead of a single calibration cell. Three cells
   are used: cell C1 is a refillable cell offering 200 mm path length and
   equipped with a pressure gauge (filled with 100 Pa N2O), cells C2 and C3
   are sealed cells offering 75 mm path length. C2 is filled with 5 Pa of
   pure N2O. Cell C3 is filled with 16 Pa N2O in 200 hPa technical air, so
   provides pressure-broadened N2O lines. We demonstrate that an ILS
   retrieval using C1 improves significantly the sensitivity of the ILS
   retrieval over the current calibration cells used in the network,
   because this cell provides narrow fully saturated N2O lines. The N2O
   columns derived from C2 and C3 allow the performance of a highly
   valuable closure experiment: adopting the ILS retrieved from C1, the N2O
   columns of C2 and C3 are derived. Because N2O is an inert gas, both
   columns should be constant on long timescales. Apparent changes in the
   columns would immediately attract attention and indicate either
   inconsistent ILS results or instrumental problems of other origin. Two
   different cells are applied for the closure experiment, because the
   NDACC spectrometers observe both stratospheric and tropospheric gases:
   C2 mimics signatures of stratospheric gases, whereas C3 mimics
   signatures of tropospheric gases.}}}

    abstract = {{An algorithm is developed to retrieve the vertical profile of carbon dioxide in the 5 to 25 km altitude range using mid-infrared solar occultation spectra from the main instrument of the ACE (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment) mission, namely the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS). The main challenge is to find an atmospheric phenomenon which can be used for accurate tangent height determination in the lower atmosphere, where the tangent heights (THs) calculated from geometric and timing information are not of sufficient accuracy. Error budgets for the retrieval of CO2 from ACE-FTS and the FTS on a potential follow-on mission named CASS (Chemical and Aerosol Sounding Satellite) are calculated and contrasted. Retrieved THs have typical biases of 60 m relative to those retrieved using the ACE version 3.x software after revisiting the temperature dependence of the N2 CIA (collision-induced absorption) laboratory measurements and accounting for sulfate aerosol extinction. After correcting for the known residual high bias of ACE version 3.x THs expected from CO2 spectroscopic/isotopic inconsistencies, the remaining bias for tangent heights determined with the N2 CIA is -20 m. CO2 in the 5-13 km range in the 2009-2011 time frame is validated against aircraft measurements from CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container), CONTRAIL (Comprehensive Observation Network for Trace gases by Airline), and HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations), yielding typical biases of -1.7 ppm in the 5-13 km range. The standard error of these biases in this vertical range is 0.4 ppm. The multi-year ACE-FTS data set is valuable in determining the seasonal variation of the latitudinal gradient which arises from the strong seasonal cycle in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere. The annual growth of CO2 in this time frame is determined to be 2.6 ± 0.4 ppm year-1, in agreement with the currently accepted global growth rate based on ground-based measurements. }},

Abstract = {{The objective, design, and implementation of the OCO inverse method are

   given atmospheric state, surface, and instrument properties. Minimizing
   bias among comparative values of X-CO2 is a critical objective. The
   algorithm uses an ``optimal,'' maximum a posteriori inverse method, with
   weak a priori constraint, and employs a state vector containing
   atmospheric and surface properties expected to vary significantly
   between soundings. An extensive operational characterization and error
   analysis will be employed, producing quantities designed to aid
   atmospheric modelers in use of the OCO data. In particular, comparison
   to inverse models of surface CO2 flux will require use of the OCO column
   averaging kernel and a priori state vector. An off-line error analysis
   has also been developed for more detailed error studies, and its use is
   illustrated by prospective application to case studies of nadir
   observations in summer and winter at three sites. Uncertainties due to

   measurements have been validated by comparison with medium-resolution

   improvements, speed-dependent profiles can now be used if line-mixing is
   treated within the first order approximation. This new package is tested
   using laboratory spectra measured in the 2.1 mu m and 4.3 mu m spectral
   regions for various pressures, temperatures and CO2 concentration
   conditions. Despite improvements at 4.3 mu m at room temperature, the
   conclusions on the quality of this update are more ambiguous at low
   temperature and in the 2.1 mu m region. Further tests using laboratory
   and atmospheric spectra are thus required for the evaluation of the

Journal = JCP,

Abstract = {{Ab initio calculations of the shapes of pure CO2 infrared and Raman
   bands under (pressure) conditions for which line-mixing effects are
   important have been performed using requantized classical molecular
   dynamics simulations. This approach provides the autocorrelation
   functions of the dipole vector and isotropic polarizability whose
   Fourier-Laplace transforms yield the corresponding spectra. For that,
   the classical equations of dynamics are solved for each molecule among
   several millions treated as linear rigid rotors and interacting through
   an anisotropic intermolecular potential. Two of the approximations used
   in the previous studies have been corrected, allowing the consideration
   of line-mixing effects without use of any adjusted parameters. The
   comparisons between calculated and experimental spectra under various
   conditions of pressure and temperature demonstrate the quality of the
   theoretical model. This opens promising perspectives for first principle
   ab initio predictions of line-mixing effects in absorption and
   scattering spectra of various systems involving linear molecules.}},

Title = {{Updated database plus software for line-mixing in CO$_2$2 infrared spectra

Journal =JQSRT,
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {2321-2331},
Abstract = {{In a previous series of papers, a model for the calculation of CO2-air
   absorption coefficients taking line-mixing into account and the
   corresponding database/software package were described and widely
   tested. In this study, we present an update of this package, based on
   the 2008 version of HITRAN, the latest currently available. The
   spectroscopic data for the seven most-abundant isotopologues are taken
   from HITRAN. When the HITRAN data are not complete up to J `'=70, the
   data files are augmented with spectroscopic parameters from the CD5D-296
   database and the high-temperature CDSD-1000 if necessary. Previously
   missing spectroscopic parameters, the air-induced pressure shifts and
   CO2 line broadening coefficients with H2O, have been added. The quality
   of this new database is demonstrated by comparisons of calculated
   absorptions and measurements using CO2 high-pressure laboratory spectra
   in the 1.5-2.3 mu m region. The influence of the imperfections and
   inaccuracies of the spectroscopic parameters from the 2000 version of
   HITRAN is clearly shown as a big improvement of the residuals is
   observed by using the new database. The very good agreements between
   calculated and measured absorption coefficients confirm the necessity of
   the update presented here and further demonstrate the importance of
   line-mixing effects, especially for the high pressures investigated
   here. The application of the updated database/software package to
   atmospheric spectra should result in an increased accuracy in the
   retrieval of CO2 atmospheric amounts. This opens improved perspectives
   for the space-borne detection of carbon dioxide sources and sinks.}},
