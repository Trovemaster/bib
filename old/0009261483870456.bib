abstract = {Vibrational states involving symmetric stretching and symmetric bending motion have been calculated for H3O+ from a SCEP CEPA potential energy surface. A very strong infrared transition with an absorption band strength of 1035 cm−2 atm−1 at 298 K is predicted at 559 cm−1 and further strong bands are calculated at 961 and 356 cm−1.}
