  Abstract                 = {The reaction of O(D-1) with N2O produces two kinds of NO molecules, the "old" one which originally exists in N2O and the "new" one which includes the attacking O atom. Using the isotopically labeled reagent, we determined the vibrational state distributions of these NO's (X (2)Pi; v=0-17) separately. To obtain the distributions, two types of experiments were performed with the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique via the NO A<--X and B<--X transitions. First, the relative populations of NO molecules (the sum of the two kinds of NO's) in v=0-11 levels were measured with unlabeled reagents. Then, isotopically labeled reaction, O-18(D-1)+(N2O)-O-16-->(NO)-O-18+(NO)-O-16, was utilized to determine the relative ratio between the two kinds of NO's in the vibrational levels of v=0-5 and 12-15. Combining the above results with previously determined vibrational state distribution of NO in high vibrational levels (v=11-17) [J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. 94, 1575 (1998)], we were able to obtain a complete set of vibrational state distributions. It was found that the old NO dominantly populated in v=0 and 1 whereas the new NO extended its population toward higher vibrational levels (v=4-15). However, in high vibrational levels, the old NO still have a considerable population due to the rapid energy transfer to the old NO. The observed efficient energy transfer to the old NO is attributed to the absence of light atoms in the present reacting system. Compared with the system including hydrogen atoms, the state density and the momentum coupling among the vibrational modes are much larger and accelerate the energy redistribution in spite of the short lifetime.

  Abstract                 = {The vibrational state distribution has been determined for vibrationally excited NO((XII)-I-2; v = 11-17) produced by the reaction of O(D-1) with N2O. O(D-1) atoms were generated by O-3 photodissociation at 266 mn and the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique via the NO (BII)-I-2 <-- (XII)-I-2 transition was utilized to obtain the vibrational state distribution. The LIF spectra were taken under conditions in which the vibrational relaxation of NO is negligible while its rotational relaxation is sufficiently achieved. The rate constant for quenching by O-3 was also determined, as the loss of NO(B) due to quenching by reactant gases should be taken into account when the LIF data are analysed Based on the large exothermicity of this reaction, significant excitation in the vibrational state of NO(X) is expected; however, the vibrational state distribution was similar to, but slightly colder than, that predicted from statistical theories. Possible mechanisms which may explain such an unexpected distribution are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Electron impact excitation of vibrational levels in the ground electronic state and nine excited electronic states in NO has been simulated for an IBC II aurora (i.e., similar to 10 kR in 3914 Angstrom radiation) in ol der to predict NO excited state number densities and band emission intensities. New integral electron impact excitation cross sections for NO were combined with a measured IBC II auroral secondary electron distribution, and the vibrational populations of 10 NO electronic states were determined under conditions of statistical equilibrium. This model predicts an extended vibrational distribution in the NO ground electronic state produced by radiative cascade from the seven higher-lying doublet excited electronic states populated by electron impact. In addition to significant energy storage in vibrational excitation of the ground electronic state, both the a (4)Pi L(2)Phi excited electronic states are predicted to have relatively high number densities because they are only weakly connected to lower electronic stales by radiative decay. Fundamental mode radiative transitions involving the lowest nine excited vibrational levels in the ground electronic state are predicted to produce infrared (IR) radiation from 5.33 to 6.05 mu m with greater intensity than any single NO electronic emission band. Fundamental mode radiative transitions within the a (4)Pi, electronic state, in the 10.08-11.37 mu m region, are predicted to have IR intensities comparable to individual electronic emission bands in the Heath and epsilon band systems. Results from this model quantitatively predict the vibrational quantum number dependence of the NO IR measurements of Espy et al. [1988].},

  Abstract                 = {The absolute intensity A3-0 of the second overtone band of NO has been measured using helium and argon as pressure broadening gases at mixture densities up to 360 amagat. The absolute intensity, obtained from the integrated absorption coefficients of NO-He and NO-Ar gaseous mixtures at high pressures, is found to be (4.08 +/- 0.21) x 10(-2) cm-2 amagat-1. From the line intensity measurement data of Meyer, Haeusler, and Barchewitz and the absolute intensity obtained with the NO-He gaseous mixtures, the rotationless matrix element R3-0 (0) of the 3-0 band of NO is calculated and its value is 7.75 x 10(-4) D. This value of R3-0 (0) is combined with previous results on the NO 1-0 and 2-0 bands to obtain a dipole moment expression accurate to M3. The following expansion for the dipole moment function in the ground state of NO is determined: M (x) = -0.166 + 2.56x - 1.94x2 -1.20x3 D, where x is the relative internuclear separation (r - r(e))/r(e).},

To retrieve accurate results from the spectra, LAMBDA-doubling and hyperfine splittings were carefully taken into account. However, for most of the studied lines, it turned out that the components of the hyperfine structure are close enough so that they have no susceptible effects on the measured line parameters. Well-chosen cases illustrate the method of measurement. The observed LAMBDA-splittings have been compared with the values deduced from the transition wavenumbers available in the HITRAN database, and large discrepancies (up to 0.006 cm-1 for P(22.5)) appeared for the 2PI3/2-2PI3/2 subband. The measured line intensities led to the determination of the transition dipole moment as well as the Herman-Wallis coefficients for the studied hot band. Our measured intensities have been found to be larger than the HITRAN values by about 7%.},

States arising from excitation to Rydberg orbitals are described well, with coupled cluster theory providing properties comparable in accuracy to multi-reference configuration interaction calculations. For the pi -> pi* valence states, larger errors are observed with density functional theory, and coupled cluster theory fails. This is associated with the multiconfigurational nature of these states. The calculations yield pseudo diabatic states, allowing the surface crossing between the B(2)Pi and C(2)Pi states to be studied directly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Aurorally enhanced 5.3 mu m emission from nitric oxide was observed by the MIPAS instrument on board the ENVISAT satellite during the solar storm of October/November 2003. Spectral modeling of the NO(Delta v = 1) fundamental band emissions was performed in order to determine the NO rotational and spin-orbit distributions. In the thermosphere, NO(nu = 1) is produced by collisional excitation of NO(nu = 0) by O atoms and also by the chemical reactions of N(S-4) and N(D-2) atoms with O-2. There are no measurements of the nascent spin-orbit distribution of NO produced by the reaction of N atoms with O-2. Auroral activity leads to increased production of N( 4 S) and N( 2 D) atoms, resulting in enhanced chemical formation of NO. In the MIPAS data taken during the solar storm, strong NO signal levels and increased rotational temperatures indicated high levels of auroral activity. A comparison of the data from October/November 2003 with data taken during a quiescent period in June 2003 showed that NO(nu = 1) produced by N + O-2 has a hotter spin-orbit distribution than NO( v = 1) produced by O atom collisional excitation. The results imply that the spin-orbit ratio may be useful for identifying different sources of NO in the thermosphere. In addition, the NO(nu = 1) spin-orbit distributions were found not to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) for both quiescent and auroral conditions. The non-LTE effects must be taken into account in order to accurately retrieve atmospheric NO concentrations from 5.3 mu m emissions.},

Energy and bond length variations of the quantum defect functions for all target states are reported. Certain small surface amplitude R-matrix poles also serve to determine the energies of valence states. Diabatic potential curves for Rydberg states converging to the (1)Sigma(+) and (3)Sigma(+) target states and for the valence states are presented. Systematic jumps in the psigma quantum defects for all target states as the bond length increases beyond R = 2.5 an are attributed to Rydbergization of the antibonding 2psigma* molecular orbital.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to interpret the experimental results of the state resolved UV-laser-induced desorption of NO from NiO(100) (rotational and vibrational populations, velocity distributions of the desorbing NO molecules, etc.), we have performed ab initio complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and configuration interaction (CI) calculations for the interaction potential between NO and the NiO(100) surface in the electronic ground state and for those excited states which are involved in the desorption process. The NiO(100)-NO distance and the tilt angle between the NO axis and the surface normal have been varied. A cluster model containing a NiO58--cluster embedded in a Madelung potential has been used for representing the NiO(100) surface. The excited states which are important for the desorption process, are charge transfer states of the substrate-adsorbate system, in which one electron is transferred from the surface into the NO-2 pi-orbital. The potential curves of these excited charge transfer states show deep minima (4 eV-5 eV) at surface/NO distances which are smaller than that in the ground state. The angular dependence of these potentials behaves similar as in the ground state. A semiempirical correction to the calculated excitation energies has been added which makes use of the bulk polarization of NiO. With this correction the charge transfer states are considerably stabilized. The lowest excitation energy amounts to about 4 eV which is in reasonable agreement with the onset of the laser desorption observed experimentally at about 3.5 eV. The density of the NO--like states is rather high, so that probably several excited states are involved in the desorption process. The potential energy curves for all of these states are quite similar, but the transitions from the ground state into different excited charge transfer states show strongly differing oscillator strengths, which are also strongly dependent on the surface/NO distance. This fact is important for the dynamics of the deexcitation process in the sense of a selection criterion for the states involved. The magnitude of the oscillator strengths is large in comparison with the excitation of NO in the gas phase, which might be an indication for the possibility of optical excitation processes. One dimensional wave packet calculations on two potential energy curves using fixed lifetimes for the excited state in each calculation have been performed and enable us to estimate the mean lifetime of the excited state to be 15 fs less than or equal to tau less than or equal to 25 fs. This implies that the dynamics of the system is dominated by the attractive part of the excited state potential. (C) 1996 American Institute of Physics.},

  Abstract                 = {Ab initio calculations including high levels of correlation treatment have been performed for the B2-PI-X2-PI-beta system of NO. The calculations are complicated by the fact that the B2-PI state gains considerable Rydberg character in the Franck-Condon region of this transition, as it approaches an avoided crossing with the C2-PI Rydberg state at shorter r values. The calculated lifetimes vary from 2.12 to 1.17-mu-s for v' = 0 to 6, as compared with the recent measurements using laser induced fluorescence that vary from 2.00 to 0.85-mu-s. Nearly exact agreement with the experimental lifetimes can be achieved by shifting the transition moment function to larger r values to simulate a more rapid onset of the Rydbergization of the B2-PI state. The calculated Einstein coefficients for v' = 6 to v" = 0-16 are in overall good agreement with experiment, but systematic differences remain that may be partially attributable to limitations in the calibration of the spectrometer.},

  Abstract                 = {Electron-impact vibrational-excitation cross sections, involving rovibrationally excited N-2 and NO molecules, are calculated for collisions occurring through the nitrogen resonant electronic state N-2(-) (X (2)Pi(g)), and the three resonant states of nitric oxide NO-( (3)Sigma(-), (1)Delta, (1)Sigma(+)). Complete sets of cross sections have been obtained for all possible transitions involving 68 vibrational levels of N-2 (X (1)Sigma(+)(g)) and 55 levels of NO(X (2)Pi), for incident electron energy between 0.1 and 10 eV. In order to study the rotational motion in the resonant processes, cross sections have also been computed for rotationally elastic transitions characterized by the rotational quantum number J running from 0 to 150. The calculations are performed within the framework of the local complex potential model, using potential energies and widths optimized to reproduce the experimental cross sections available in the literature. Rate coefficients are calculated for transitions between all vibrational levels by assuming a Maxwellian electron energy distribution function in the temperature range from 0.1 to 100 eV.

  Abstract                 = {We give a simple two-transition model of Faraday modulation spectrometry (FAMOS) addressing the electronic X-2 Pi(nu ''=0) - A(2)Sigma(+) (nu=0) band in nitric oxide. The model is given in terms of the integrated line strength, S, and first Fourier coefficients for the magnetic-field-modulated dispersive line shape function. Although the two states addressed respond differently to the magnetic field (they adhere to the dissimilar Hund coupling cases), it is shown that the technique shares some properties with FAMOS when rotational-vibrational Q-transitions are targeted: the line shapes have a similar form and the signal strength has an analogous magnetic field and pressure dependence. The differences are that the maximum signal appears for larger magnetic field amplitudes and pressures, similar to 1500 G and similar to 200 Torr, respectively. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America},

  Abstract                 = {The two NO(X2PI, upsilon=1, OMEGA=1/2,3/2) spin-orbit populations in the Earth's thermosphere have been found to depart by more than a factor of 2 from the ratio expected from thermal equilibrium. The effective temperature describing the observed population distribution is as much as 700 K lower than the local kinetic temperature. Absolute NO(upsilon=1, J, OMEGA) column densities were derived from high-resolution (1 cm-1) infrared earthlimb spectra for tangent altitudes up to 200 km, obtained in the CIRRIS 1A Space Shuttle experiment. Nonlinear least-squares synthetic spectral fitting was used to analyze the NO DELTAupsilon=1 fundamental band emissions near 5.3 mum. The spin-orbit distribution represents and third degree of freedom, along with vibration and rotation, that is not in equilibrium with the local kinetic temperature. These observations may significantly impact the interpretation of band-integrated measurements of NO in the upper atmosphere, for which equilibrium sublevel distributions have been assumed. The subthermal distribution is most likely produced in the collisional uppumping of NO(upsilon=0) by O atoms, which is the major source of NO(upsilon=1) in the thermosphere. This inference suggests that the present effect is related to the subthermal spin-orbit distributions observed in laboratory studies of NO2 photodissociation.},

The measured collision free lifetimes of 206 +/- 7 ns for A (2)Sigma(+), upsilon' = 0, and 18 +/- 1 ns for D (2)Sigma(+), upsilon' = 0 are used to place transition probabilities on an absolute basis. The branching ratio for D --> X is 3.0 +/- 0.3 times that for D --> A and more than 30 times that for D --> C. The ratio of two-photon absorption cross sections for D-X(0,0)/A-X(4,0) is 6 +/- 2 and the photoionization probability from D, upsilon' = 0 is larger than from A, upsilon' = 4 at 375 nm. Also, the two-photon excitation of A-X(4,0) has an unusual intensity distribution, probably due either to interference between intermediate states in the excitation or to anomalies in the photoionization step.

  Abstract                 = {Laser multiphoton ionisation and fragmentation processes have been studied in many molecular species, including a large number of substituted aromatic compounds. Recent studies in this laboratory on nitrobenzene have yielded significant data on the wavelength dependence of laser-induced ionisation and fragmentation processes: in particular, the verv striking behaviour of the NO fragment. In this paper we extend the wavelength range to study nitrobenzene at shorter wavelengths and also investigate another nitroaromatic compound, o-nitrotoluene, where similar behaviour is observed. We also report laser ionisation of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over the same wavelength region. Comparison of the various spectra suggests that the nitroaromatic parent molecules predissociate releasing NO2, which in turn predissociates to form NO before going through a multiphoton ionisation process. The hydrocarbon components of the o-nitrotoluene molecule also ionise, but there is no evidence of distinctive resonance enhancement of any of these fragment ions in the wavelength range studied.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first unbiased molecular line survey toward an extragalactic source, namely the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. The scan covers the frequency band from 129.1 to 175.2 GHz, i.e., most of the 2 mm atmospheric window. We identify 111 spectral features as transitions from 25 different molecular species. Eight of which ( three tentatively) are detected for the first time in the extragalactic interstellar medium. Among these newly detected species, we detected the rare isotopomers (SO)-S-34 and (HCO+)-O-18. Tentative detections of two deuterated species, DNC and N2D+, are reported for the first time from a target beyond the Magellanic Clouds. In addition, three hydrogen recombination lines are identified, while no organic molecules larger than methanol are detected. Column densities and rotation temperatures are calculated for all the species, including an upper limit to the ethanol abundance. A comparison of the chemical composition of the nuclear environment of NGC 253 with those of selected nearby galaxies demonstrates the chemical resemblance of IC 342 and NGC 4945 to that of NGC 253. On the other hand, the chemistries characterizing NGC 253 and M82 are clearly different. We also present a comparison of the chemical composition of NGC 253 with those observed in Galactic prototypical sources. The chemistry of NGC 253 shows a striking similarity with the chemistry observed toward the Galactic center molecular clouds, which are thought to be dominated by low-velocity shocks. This resemblance strongly suggests that the heating in the nuclear environment of NGC 253 is dominated by the same mechanism as that in the central region of the Milky Way.},

  Abstract                 = {We present molecular dynamics simulations of the photodissociated state of MbNO performed at 300 K using a fluctuating charge model for the nitric oxide (NO) ligand. After dissociation, NO is observed to remain mainly in the centre of the distal haem pocket, although some movement towards the primary docking site and the xenon-4 pocket can be seen. We calculate the NO infrared spectrum for the photodissociated ligand within the haem pocket and find a narrow peak in the range 1915-1922 cm(-1). The resulting blue shift of 1, to 8 cm(-1) compared to gas-phase NO is much smaller than the red shifts calculated and observed for carbon monoxide (CO) in Mb. A small splitting, due to NO in the xenon-4, pocket, is also observed. At lower, temperatures, the spectra and conformational space explored by the ligand remain largely unchanged, but the electrostatic interactions with residue His64, become increasingly significant in determining the details of the ligand orientation within the distal haem pocket. The investigation, of the effect of the L29F mutation reveals significant differences between the behaviour of NO and that of CO, and suggests a coupling between the ligand and the protein dynamics due to the different ligand dipole moments.},

  Abstract                 = {A beam containing NO in the long-lived:a (II)-I-4 state was allowed to interact with target particles in a collision-cell. Intramolecular collision-induced transitions;a (II)-I-4 --> B (II)-I-2 and a (II)-I-4 --> b (4) Sigma(-) were observed via the subsequent emissions in the beta bands (B (II)-I-2 --> X (II)-I-2) and the Ogawa bands (b (4) Sigma(-) --> (II)-I-4), respectively. In the ultraviolet part of the spectrum long beta band progressions originating from the B-state vibrational levels v=0 and 3 were observed. In each band only a few lines appear, which were assigned to transitions from the rotational levels (II3/2)-I-2(10.5) in v=0 and (II1/2)-I-2( 17.5) in v=3. These particular B (II)-I-2 levels are perturbed by specific levels of the a (II)-I-4 state, serving as so-called gateways to allow the otherwise spin-forbidden a (II)-I-4, --> B (II)-I-2 collision-induced transition. An external magnetic field has strong effect on the collision-induced emission from the NO(B, v=0) level. With paramagnetic target gases, direct spin-changing NO(a--> B) collisional transfer was also observed in addition to the gateway transitions. The selectivity for the final state level is much weaker here. The collision-induced Ogawa band emission in the near-infrared showed smooth, partially resolved rotational contours with all target gases. This indicates that the collisional. transfer NO(a-->b) within the quartet system is also not of the highly restrictive gateway:type, but results from direct collisional coupling.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper details an investigation of the variation in the electronic transition moment with internuclear separation for the NO(B2-PI-X2-PI) transition. Measurements of the relative intensities of a number of NO B-X vibronic transitions having a common upper level were used to construct a relative transition-moment function between 1.27 and 1.60 angstrom. After normalizing this relative function by experimentally determined radiative lifetimes, the transition-moment function was extended down to 1.23 angstrom by incorporating data from oscillator strength measurements. In contrast to empirical transition-moment functions that have been proposed previously, the function in this paper decreases with increasing internuclear separation. Unlike these other functions, however, this one is consistent with theoretical predictions, with most available oscillator strength data, and with the observed trend in B-state radiative lifetimes as a function of vibrational level.},

  Abstract                 = {Potential energy, electric field gradient (EFG) at both nuclei, and electric dipole moment functions for the electronic ground states of NO, NO and NO- were calculated at the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction (icMRCI) level using augmented correlation-consistent basis sets. The changes in the EFG's with internuclear separation R were used to interpret the character of bonding in the triad of NO species. The vibrational dependences of the electric properties were estimated and the EFG's were employed to determine the N-14 nuclear quadrupole coupling constants. The effects of the choice of the basis set and reference configuration space were investigated. While the results obtained for NO+ and NO served primarily to assess the quality of calculations by comparison with available experimental and theoretical data, new information was obtained on NO-, including electric property functions and some notions about the existence of metastable states.

  Abstract                 = {Aims. During a full line survey towards IRC +10420 in the 3 and 1 mm bands, we detected the emission of circumstellar nitric oxide for the first time. We aim to study the formation of NO and to confirm the enrichment of nitrogen expected for the most massive, evolved stars predicted by the hot bottom burning process. Methods. We counted on a detailed model of the structure and kinematics of the molecular gas around IRC +10420. In addition, we used a chemical model to derive the NO abundance profile. We modified the initial nitrogen abundance in order to fit the observed NO profiles. These synthetic profiles were obtained using an LVG radiative transfer code. Results. We have detected NO in a circumstellar envelope for the first time, along with a variety of N-rich molecules, which in turn shows that IRC +10420 presents a N-rich chemistry. Furthermore, we have found that to reproduce the observed NO line profiles, the initial abundance of nitrogen in the chemical model has to be increased by a factor 20 with respect to the values of the standard O-rich stars.},

R-matrix calculations which include 12 configuration interaction target states in the close-coupling expansion are performed. Rydberg states of up to n = 10 are studied for the (2) Sigma(+), (2) Pi and (2) Delta symmetries of NO. Intruder states, of both valence and Rydberg character, are followed both above and below the ionization threshold. Where possible these states are classified as Rydberg states of an excited state of the ion. Away from avoided crossings, it is found that the quantum defects of the Rydberg series converging on the X (1) Sigma(+) state of NO+ show little sensitivity to bondlength but show considerable dependence on the number of states included in the close-coupled expansion.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of the outermost valence electron orbital momentum profiles of the open shell molecules NO, O-2 and NO2 have been obtained using electron momentum spectroscopy (EMS). The presently reported experimental momentum profiles of NO and O-2 display much improved statistics compared with previously published EMS results while the data for the HOMO of NO, is the first reported. In the case of NO, the present measurements are considerably different from previous results and these differences appear to be due to the presence of NO2 impurities in the previous work. The EMS measurements provide a stringent test of basis set effects and the quality of ab initio methods in the description of these open shell systems. The experimental momentum profiles have been compared with theoretical spherically averaged momentum profiles from several basis sets calculated at the level of the target Hartree-Fock approximation (THFA) with a range of basis sets using both unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) and restricted open shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) methods. Various configuration interaction calculations such as multi-reference singles and doubles configuration interaction (MRSD-CI), averaged coupled pair functional (ACPF) and quasi-degenerate variational perturbation theory (QDVPT) calculations of the full ion-neutral overlap amplitude have also been compared to experiment to investigate the effects of electron correlation and relaxation. The experimental momentum profiles have further been compared to calculations at the level of the target Kohn-Sham approximation (TKSA) using density functional theory (DFT) with the local density approximation and also with gradient corrected exchange-correlation potentials. In addition to momentum profiles, other electronic properties such as total energies, dipole moments, quadrupole moments and values of the electronic spatial extent have been calculated by the various theoretical methods and compared to experimental values.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the status of the 2012 edition of the HITRAN molecular spectroscopic compilation. The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN edition of 2008 and its updates during the intervening years. The HITRAN molecular absorption compilation is comprised of six major components structured into folders that are freely accessible on the internet. These folders consist of the traditional line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes, infrared absorption cross-sections for molecules not yet amenable to representation in a line-by-line form, ultraviolet spectroscopic parameters, aerosol indices of refraction, collision-induced absorption data, and general tables such as partition sums that apply globally to the data. The new HITRAN is greatly extended in terms of accuracy, spectral coverage, additional absorption phenomena, and validity. Molecules and isotopologues have been added that address the issues of atmospheres beyond the Earth. Also discussed is a new initiative that casts HITRAN into a relational database format that offers many advantages over the long-standing sequential text-based structure that has existed since the initial release of HITRAN in the early 1970s.

  Abstract                 = {A new molecular spectroscopic database for high-temperature modeling of the spectra of molecules in the gas phase is described. This database, called HITEMP, is analogous to the HITRAN database but encompasses many more bands and transitions than HITRAN for the absorbers H2O, CO2, CO, NO, and OH. HITEMP provides users with a powerful tool for a great many applications: astrophysics, planetary and stellar atmospheres, industrial processes, surveillance, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium problems, and investigating molecular interactions, to name a few. The sources and implementation of the spectroscopic parameters incorporated into HITEMP are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Improved measurements of the radiative lifetimes of NO A (2)Sigma(+)(v' = 0,1,2) are presented and used to update the absolute electronic transition moment for the NO gamma bands. The pressure-dependent fluorescence decay rate was measured in a low-pressure, room-temperature, flow cell containing dilute mixtures of NO in N-2 using time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence excited with a picosecond laser and detected with a microchannel-plate photomultiplier tube. Fluorescence decay rates were determined using an analysis procedure that accounted for the electronic response of the detection system and measurement noise. Radiative lifetimes were determined from an extrapolation of the measured decay rates to zero pressure. In comparison with prior measurements of these radiative lifetimes, the improved experimental approach and analysis procedure result in a significant improvement in the measurement precision. The accuracy of the fluorescence decay-rate measurements was confirmed by independent measurements using time-correlated single-photon counting and time-resolved probing of laser-excited population in A (2)Sigma(+) using 266 nm photoionization and charge detection. The measured radiative lifetimes are 192.6 +/- 0.2 ns for v' = 0, 186.2 +/- 0.4 ns for v' = 1, and 179.4 +/- 0.7 ns for v' = 2. The measured lifetimes are shown to be in outstanding agreement with those predicted by an electronic transition moment that is identical in form to the function recommended by Luque and Crosley [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 7405 (1999)] after appropriate rescaling. This rescaling does not affect the agreement of the transition moment function with the previously reported vibrational branching ratios and improves agreement with previously reported absolute oscillator strength measurements. Based on the rescaled transition moment, updated values of absolute transition probabilities in the NO A (2)Sigma(+)-X (2)Pi system are presented. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

  Abstract                 = {A first demonstration of Faraday modulation spectrometry (FAMOS) of nitric oxide ( NO) addressing its strong electronic X-2 Pi(nu ''=0) = A(2)Sigma(+) (nu'=0) band is presented. The instrumentation was constructed around a fully diode-laser-based laser system producing mW powers of ultraviolet light targeting the overlapping Q(22)(21/2) and R-Q(12)(21/2) transitions at similar to 226.6 nm. The work verifies a new two-transition model of FAMOS addressing the electronic transitions in NO given in an accompanying work. Although the experimental instrumentation could address neither the parameter space of the theory nor the optimum conditions, the line shapes and the pressure dependence could be verified under low-field conditions. NO could be detected down to a partial pressure of 13 mu Torr, roughly corresponding to 10 ppb.m for an atmospheric pressure sample, which demonstrates the feasibility of FAMOS for sensitive detection of NO addressing its strong electronic band.

  Abstract                 = {Reaction of fast non-thermal N(4S) atoms with O2 molecules is shown to produce NO with large rotational and vibrational excitation. It is suggested that the process is responsible for the highly rotationally excited nitric oxide detected by the space shuttle experiment CIRRIS 1A. The influence of translationally hot atoms on the chemical composition and energetics of planetary thermospheres has been investigated by Logan and McElroy [1976], Solomon [1983], Fox and Dalgarno [1983], Nagy et al. [1990], and Gerard et al. [1991, 1993]. Shematovich et al. [1991], using a non-equilibrium kinetic model, have calculated the steady-state translational energy distribution of the ground state (4S) nitrogen atoms in the daylit atmosphere of the Earth at 140 km altitude. The calculated distribution shows a significant overpopulation of higher energy atoms over a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at the local translational temperature of 555K, of one and three orders of magnitude at energies of 0.5eV and 0.75eV, respectively, and the rate coefficient k(ne) for the process N(4S) + O2 --> NO + O + 1.385eV (1) is enhanced by several orders of magnitude over the thermal rate coefficient k(e). At an altitude of 110 km, where the temperature is about 275K, the thermal rate coefficient obtained from the standard expression k(e) = 4.4 x 10(-12)exp[-3220/T]cm3sec-1 [Rees, 1989] is 3.6 x 10(-17)cm3sec-1, whereas the nonequilibrium value is 2.0 x 10(-11)cm3s-1 [Shematovich et al. 1991]. The reaction of the hot N(4S) atoms with O2 provides an additional mechanism for the production of nitric oxide. Gerard et al. [1991] calculated that for solar minimum conditions at equatorial latitudes this additional mechanism contributes 6 to 30 percent of the nitric oxide,produced in the lower thermosphere.},

The sensor is based on a near-IR diode laser operating near 1.8 mu m, which probes isolated transitions in the second overtone (3,0) absorption band of NO. Based on absorption cell data, the sensitivity for ambient atmospheric pressure conditions is of the order of 30 parts in 10(6) by volume for a meter path (ppmv-m), assuming a minimum measurable absorbance of 10(-5). Initial H-2-air flame measurements are complicated by strong water vapor absorption features that constrain the available gain and dynamic range of the present detection system. Preliminary results suggest that detection limits in this environment of the order of 140 ppmv-m could be achieved with optimum baseline correction. (C) 1997 Optical Society of America.},

  Abstract                 = {Solar McMath FTS spectra, recorded with a full instrumental width of about 0.0064 cm-1, were obtained of the fundamental vibration-rotation band (v = 1 <-- 0) of (NO)-N-14-O-16. These spectra have been used to determine N2-induced-broadening and N2-induced-shift coefficients as well as line intensities and positions. Measurements were made from 1780 to 1952 cm-1, up to Absolute value of m almost-equal-to 22.5, for the P and R branches of the 2PI1/2 and 2PI3/2 subbands and a few transitions of the Q branch. The rotationless transition moments of the two sub-bands were found to be within 1/2% of each other. The first-order Herman-Wallis intensity factor, C, measured for the first time, is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. The band intensity is 114.9 +/- 3.4 cm-2 atm-1 at 296 K. The v = 1 <-- 0 N2-broadened widths and N2-induced pressure shifts are, respectively, 3% different and a factor of 2 smaller than those measured by Pine et al. [J. Mol. Spectrosc. 114, 132-147 ( 1985 ) ] for the v = 2 <-- 0 band. The broadening coefficients are, where comparisons can be made, a few to about twenty percent smaller and the intensities about four percent larger than results reported by Ballard et al. [J. Mol. Spectrosc. 127, 70-82 (1988)]. Line positions are retrieved and calibrated to an accuracy of +/-5 X 10(-5) cm-1 using the 1-0 band of CO. Comparisons of calculated positions based on the constants of Hinz et al. [J. Mol. Spectrosc. 119, 120-125 ( 1986)] reveal very good agreement for the 2PI3/2 subband and a systematic divergence for the 2PI/2 positions. The effects of hyperfine splittings are also detected for low m transitions. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Equilibrium geometries, bond dissociation energies, dipole moments, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and infrared intensities were calculated for a set of ten neutral nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2, NO3, N2O, sym N2O2, asym N2O3, sym N2O3, sym N2O4, asym N2O4, and N2O5) by applying one local and two gradient-corrected nonlocal functionals in a Gaussian-type-orbital density functional method. Comparison with available experimental data shows that, except for the bond dissociation energies, the local functional gives very accurate molecular properties. Nonlocal functionals considerably improve the bond dissociation energies, but the results still overestimate the experimental values by about 10 kcal/mol on average. For the other properties, the results obtained with nonlocal functionals are not necessarily superior to those calculated with the local functional. The properties of two molecules (sym N2O3 and asym N2O4) are predicted for the first time and several reassignments are proposed in the vibrational spectra of di-nitrogen oxides.},

  Abstract                 = {Soft x-ray emission spectra of the open shell NO molecule are simulated using multiconfiguration self-consistent field ab initio calculations with an extensive triple zeta atomic natural orbital basis set. All states involved in the spectral simulation are optimized individually for their minimal energy geometries. The valence-ionized states with open shells (both the singlet and the triplet) exhibit longer N-O bond lengths than the neutral NO ground electronic state; whereas the closed shell valence-ionized state of X (1)Sigma(+) has the shortest bond length among the states involved. For the core-ionized states, however, the calculations indicate the lengthening of the N-O bond for core ionizations centred on the oxygen atom but contraction for the ionizations centred on nitrogen. Nuclear dynamics has been applied to the spectral simulations in order to construct the vibrational envelope associated with the x-ray emission processes. The simulated O-K and N-K spectra of NO agree well with the available experiment. The characteristics of the potential energy surfaces of the N1s and O1s core states explain the differences in the O-K and N-K emission spectra of NO.},

  Abstract                 = {We observe electron emission when vibrationally excited NO molecules with vibrational state v, in the range of 9 <= v <= 18, are scattered from a Cs-dosed Au surface. The quantum efficiency increases strongly with v, increasing up to 10(-2) electrons per NO (v) collision, a value several orders of magnitude larger than that observed in experiments with similar molecules in the ground vibrational state. The electron emission signal, as a function of v, has a threshold where the vibrational excitation energy slightly exceeds the surface work function. This threshold behavior strongly suggests that we are observing the direct conversion of NO vibrational energy into electron kinetic energy. Several potential mechanisms for the observed electron emission are explored, including (1) vibrational autodetachment, (2) an Auger-type two-electron process, and (3) vibrationally promoted dissociation. The results of this work provide direct evidence for nonadiabatic energy-transfer events associated with large amplitude vibrational motion at metal surfaces.

  Abstract                 = {The stimulated emission pumping (SEP) technique has made the study of highly vibrationally excited molecules increasingly appealing, enabling sophisticated spectroscopic probes to be converted to preparation techniques. With such an approach even relatively improbable processes, such as vibrational energy transfer and chemical reactivity, may be studied. This article describes studies of the vibrational quantum number dependence of the vibrational relaxation of highly vibrationally excited nitric oxide and oxygen. The NO experiments are one of the first data sets on bimolecular energy transfer for molecules with several hundreds of kJ/mol of internal energy. Information is obtained showing to what extent energy transfer theories designed for low vibrational energy can be applied in this case. Strong evidence is also obtained suggesting that qualitatively different mechanisms such as 'transient chemical bond formation'' can influence the rate of vibrational energy transfer at high vibrational energy. Analogous experiments on O2 have also been carried out. Compelling evidence for the vibrationally enhanced endothermic chemical reaction O2(v) + O2 --> O3 + O has been obtained. The possible relevance of these results to the stratospheric ozxone budget is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The dependence of vibrational energy transfer on vibrational excitation has been studied using the stimulated emission pumping technique to efficiently prepare a large range of specific vibrational states of the nitric oxide molecule in its ground electronic state. Laser induced fluorescence was used to detect collisionally relaxed NO. The self-relaxation rate constants of NO (upsilon >> 1) were up to 200 times larger than that of NO (upsilon = 1). Multiquantum relaxation was found to be important at high energy and was quantified at 3.8 eV. Self-relaxation rate constants of N-15O-18 as well as N-14O-16 were measured and a large isotope effect was observed. Relaxation of NO (upsilon" = 22) with H-2 was also investigated. Theoretical explanations of our experimental results were attempted and it is shown that at vibrational energy up to almost-equal-to 3 eV the qualitative trends observed in these experiments such as the mass effect and the multiquantum relaxation can be explained by Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzfeld theory. A simple explanation of the anomalously high NO self-relaxation rate is given. The large acceleration of the vibrational relaxation rate above 3.0 eV is coincident with the energetic onset of high energy (NO)2 isomer complexes. More theoretical and experimental work is needed to explain the quantitative aspects of these observations.},

By comparing this new set of results with previously measured results for upsilon = 2 [Aa. Sudbo and M. M. T. Loy, J. Chem. Phys. 76, 3646 (1982)] the vibrational influence on the rotational and spin-orbit energy transfer dynamics could be evaluated. Total depopulation rate constants for individual rovibrational states were found to be very similar for upsilon = 2, 8, and 19. State-to-state rotational energy transfer rate constants could be compared for upsilon = 8 and 19, and again only small differences were found. It appears that vibrational energy does not have a significant impact on the rotational and spin-orbit energy transfer dynamics for NO-NO collisions.},

  Abstract                 = {A tunable diode laser-based sensor for measuring the concentrations of NO has been developed. In this paper, the measured spectra of NO 3v band (the R branch), H2O and CO2 lines in the spectral region from 5565 to 5588 cm at 600K were analyzed and compared with each other to select optimum transitions for measuring NO concentration. The absorption transitions R (7.5) were selected according to HITRAN database to minimize interference from water vapor and CO2. The line strength is about 10(-23) CM-1 / (molecule/cm(2)), and a minimum detectable of 30 ppm was obtained with wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS-2f) method. The 1.79 mu m distributed feed-back (DFB) diode laser has a narrow line width. The measurement was validated in a gas cell at 300K, where NO concentrations using both scanned-wavelength direct absorption (DA) and wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS-2f) strategies were validated against calibrated mixture concentrations. Then the wavelength modulation measurement was validated in heated gas cell in a tubular furnace (373 similar to 573K). The laboratory use LabVIEW program to realize data acquisition and to realize the real-time display of the concentration of the gas through direct absorption method. In the laboratory, we also analyze the concentrations of the NO using WMS at different temperature (300K-573K).},

  Abstract                 = {Nitric oxide has been newly detected toward several star-forming clouds, including Orion-KL, Sgr B2(N), W33A, W51M, and DR21(OH) via its J = 3/2 --> 1/2 transitions near 150 GHz, using the FCRAO 14 m telescope. Both lambda-doubling components of NO were observed towards all sources. Column densities derived for nitric oxide in these clouds are N approximately 10(15)-10(16) cm-2, corresponding to fractional abundances of f approximately 0.5-1.0 x 10(-8), relative to H2. Towards Orion-KL, the NO line profile suggests that the species arises primarily from hot, dense gas. Nitric oxide may arise from warm material toward the other clouds as well. Nitric oxide in star-forming regions could be synthesized by high-temperature reactions, although the observed abundances do not disagree with values predicted from low-temperature, ion-molecule chemistry by more than one order of magnitude. The abundance of NO, unlike other simple interstellar nitrogen compounds, does appear to be reproduced by chemical models, at least to a good approximation. Regardless of the nature of formation of NO, it appears to be a common constituent of warm, dense molecular clouds. N-O bonds may therefore be more prevalent than previously thought.},
