  abstract = {An accurate and comprehensive room temperature rotation-vibration
	transition line list for phosphine (({PH$_3$})-P-31) is computed using
	a newly refined potential energy surface and a previously constructed
	ab initio electric dipole moment surface. Energy levels, Einstein
	A coefficients and transition intensities are computed using these
	surfaces and a variational approach to the nuclear motion problem
	as implemented in the program TROVE. A to-vibrational spectrum is
	computed, covering the wavenumber range 0-8000 {cm$^{-1}$}. The resulting
	line list, which is appropriate for temperatures up to 300 K, consists
	of a total of 137 million transitions between 5.6 million energy
	levels. Several of the band centres are shifted to better match experimental
	transition frequencies. The line list is compared to the most recent
	HITRAN database and other laboratorial sources. Transition wavelengths
	and intensities are generally found to be in good agreement with
	the existing experimental data, with particularly close agreement
	for the rotational spectrum. An analysis of the comparison between
	the theoretical data created and the existing experimental data is
	performed, and suggestions for future improvements and assignments
	to the HITRAN database are made. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights
